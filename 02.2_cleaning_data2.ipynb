(L'AVARE.) BY MOLIÈRE TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH PROSE. WITH A SHORT INTRODUCTION AND EXPLANATORY NOTES. BY CHARLES HERON WALL This play was acted for the first time on September 9, 1668. In it,  Molière has borrowed from Plautus, and has imitated several other  authors, but he far surpasses them in the treatment of his subject.  The picture of the miser, in whom love of money takes the place of all  natural affections, who not only withdraws from family intercourse,  but considers his children as natural enemies, is finely drawn, and  renders Molière's Miser altogether more dramatic and moral than those  of his predecessors. Molière acted the part of Harpagon. PERSONS REPRESENTED. Harpagon , father to Cléante , in love with Marianne . Cléante , Harpagon's son, lover to Marianne .

What, dear Élise! you grow sad after having given me such dear  tokens of your love; and I see you sigh in the midst of my joy! Can  you regret having made me happy? and do you repent of the engagement  which my love has forced from you? Eli .  No, Valère, I do not regret what I do for you; I feel carried on  by too delightful a power, and I do not even wish that things should  be otherwise than they are. Yet, to tell you the truth, I am very  anxious about the consequences; and I greatly fear that I love you  more than I should. Val .  What can you possibly fear from the affection you have shown me? Eli .  Everything; the anger of my father, the reproaches of my family,  the censure of the world, and, above all, Valère, a change in your  heart! I fear that cruel coldness with which your sex so often repays  the too warm proofs of an innocent love. Val .  Alas! do not wrong me thus; do not judge of me by others. Think  me capable of everything, Élise, except of falling short of what I owe  to you. I love you too much for that; and my love will be as lasting  as my life! Eli .  Ah! Valère, all men say the same thing; all men are alike in  their words; their actions only show the difference that exists  between them. Val .  Then why not wait for actions, if by them alone you can judge of  the truthfulness of my heart? Do not suffer your anxious fears to  mislead you, and to wrong me. Do not let an unjust suspicion destroy  the happiness which is to me dearer than life; but give me time to  show you by a thousand proofs the sincerity of my affection. Eli .  Alas! how easily do we allow ourselves to be persuaded by those  we love. I believe you, Valère; I feel sure that your heart is utterly  incapable of deceiving me, that your love is sincere, and that you  will ever remain faithful to me. I will no longer doubt that happiness  is near. If I grieve, it will only be over the difficulties of our  position, and the possible censures of the world. Val . But why even this fear? Eli .  Oh, Valère! if everybody knew you as I do, I should not have much  to fear. I find in you enough to justify all I do for you; my heart  knows all your merit, and feels, moreover, bound to you by deep  gratitude. How can I forget that horrible moment when we met for the  first time? Your generous courage in risking your own life to save  mine from the fury of the waves; your tender care afterwards; your  constant attentions and your ardent love, which neither time nor  difficulties can lessen! For me you neglect your parents and your  country; you give up your own position in life to be a servant of my  father! How can I resist the influence that all this has over me? Is  it not enough to justify in my eyes my engagement to you? Yet, who  knows if it will be enough to justify it in the eyes of others? and  how can I feel sure that my motives will be understood? Val .  You try in vain to find merit in what I have done; it is by my  love alone that I trust to deserve you. As for the scruples you feel,  your father himself justifies you but too much before the world; and  his avarice and the distant way in which he lives with his children  might authorise stranger things still. Forgive me, my dear Élise, for  speaking thus of your father before you; but you know that,  unfortunately, on this subject no good can be said of him. However, if  I can find my parents, as I fully hope I shall, they will soon be  favourable to us. I am expecting news of them with great impatience;  but if none comes I will go in search of them myself. Eli .  Oh no! Valère, do not leave me, I entreat you. Try rather to  ingratiate yourself in my father's favour. Val .  You know how much I wish it, and you can see how I set about it.  You know the skilful manoeuvres I have had to use in order to  introduce myself into his service; under what a mask of sympathy and  conformity of tastes I disguise my own feelings to please him; and  what a part I play to acquire his affection. I succeed wonderfully  well, and I feel that to obtain favour with men, there are no better  means than to pretend to be of their way of thinking, to fall in with  their maxims, to praise their defects, and to applaud all their  doings. One need not fear to overdo it, for however gross the  flattery, the most cunning are easily duped; there is nothing so  impertinent or ridiculous which they will not believe, provided it be  well seasoned with praise. Honesty suffers, I acknowledge; but when we  have need of men, we may be allowed without blame to adapt ourselves  to their mode of thought; and if we have no other hope of success but  through such stratagem, it is not after all the fault of those who  flatter, but the fault of those who wish to be flattered. Eli .  Why do you not try also to gain my brother's goodwill, in case  the servant should betray our secret? Val .  I am afraid I cannot humour them both. The temper of the father  is so different from that of the son that it would be difficult to be  the confidant of both at the same time. Rather try your brother  yourself; make use of the love that exists between you to enlist him  in our cause. I leave you, for I see him coming. Speak to him, sound  him, and see how far we can trust him. Eli .  I greatly fear I shall never have the courage to speak to him of  my secret. SCENE II.——CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, Cle .  I am very glad to find you alone, sister. I longed to speak to  you and to tell you a secret. Eli .  I am quite ready to hear you, brother. What is it you have to  tell me? Cle .  Many things, sister, summed up in one word—love. Eli . You love? Cle .  Yes, I love. But, before I say more, let me tell you that I know  I depend on my father, and that the name of son subjects me to his  will; that it would be wrong to engage ourselves without the consent  of the authors of our being; that heaven has made them the masters of  our affections, and that it is our duty not to dispose of ourselves  but in accordance to their wish; that their judgment is not biassed by  their being in love themselves; that they are, therefore, much more  likely not to be deceived by appearances, and to judge better what is  good for us; that we ought to trust their experience rather than the  passion which blinds us; and that the rashness of youth often carries  us to the very brink of dangerous abysses. I know all this, my sister,  and I tell it you to spare you the trouble of saying it to me, for my  love will not let me listen to anything, and I pray you to spare me  your remonstrances. Eli .  Have you engaged yourself, brother, to her you love? Cle .  No, but I have determined to do so; and I beseech you once more  not to bring forward any reason to dissuade me from it. Eli .  Am I such a very strange person, brother? Cle .  No, dear sister; but you do not love. You know not the sweet  power that love has upon our hearts; and I dread your wisdom. Eli .  Alas! my brother, let us not speak of my wisdom. There are very  few people in this world who do not lack wisdom, were it only once in  their lifetime; and if I opened my heart to you, perhaps you would  think me less wise than you are yourself. Cle .  Ah! would to heaven that your heart, like mine … Eli .  Let us speak of you first, and tell me whom it is you love. Cle .  A young girl who has lately come to live in our neighbourhood,  and who seems made to inspire love in all those who behold her.  Nature, my dear sister, has made nothing more lovely; and I felt  another man the moment I saw her. Her name is Marianne, and she lives  with a good, kind mother, who is almost always ill, and for whom the  dear girl shows the greatest affection. She waits upon her, pities and  comforts her with a tenderness that would touch you to the very soul.  Whatever she undertakes is done in the most charming way; and in all  her actions shine a wonderful grace, a most winning gentleness, an  adorable modesty, a … ah! my sister, how I wish you had but seen  her. Eli .  I see many things in what you tell me, dear brother; and it is  sufficient for me to know that you love her for me to understand what  she is. Cle .  I have discovered, without their knowing it, that they are not in  very good circumstances, and that, although they live with the  greatest care, they have barely enough to cover their expenses. Can  you imagine, my sister, what happiness it must be to improve the  condition of those we love; skilfully to bring about some relief to  the modest wants of a virtuous family? And think what grief it is for  me to find myself deprived of this great joy through the avarice of a  father, and for it to be impossible for me to give any proof of my  love to her who is all in all to me. Eli .  Yes, I understand, dear brother, what sorrow this must be to you. Cle .  It is greater, my sister, than you can believe. For is there  anything more cruel than this mean economy to which we are subjected?  this strange penury in which we are made to pine? What good will it do  us to have a fortune if it only comes to us when we are not able to  enjoy it; if now to provide for my daily maintenance I get into debt  on every side; if both you and I are reduced daily to beg the help of  tradespeople in order to have decent clothes to wear? In short, I  wanted to speak to you that you might help me to sound my father  concerning my present feelings; and if I find him opposed to them, I  am determined to go and live elsewhere with this most charming girl,  and to make the best of what Providence offers us. I am trying  everywhere to raise money for this purpose; and if your circumstances,  dear sister, are like mine, and our father opposes us, let us both  leave him, and free ourselves from the tyranny in which his hateful  avarice has for so long held us. Eli .  It is but too true that every day he gives us more and more  reason to regret the death of our mother, and that … Cle .  I hear his voice. Let us go a little farther and finish our talk.  We will afterwards join our forces to make a common attack on his hard  and unkind heart. SCENE III.——HARPAGON, LA FLÈCHE. Har .  Get out of here, this moment; and let me have no more of your  prating. Now then, be gone out of my house, you sworn pickpocket, you  veritable gallows' bird. La Fl . ( aside ).  I never saw anything more wicked than this  cursed old man; and I truly believe, if I may be allowed to say so,  that he is possessed with a devil. Har .  What are you muttering there between your teeth? La Fl . Why do you send me away? Har .  You dare to ask me my reasons, you scoundrel? Out with you, this  moment, before I give you a good thrashing. La Fl .  What have I done to you? Har .  Done this, that I wish you to be off. La Fl .  My master, your son, gave me orders to wait for him. Har .  Go and wait for him in the street, then; out with you; don't stay  in my house, straight and stiff as a sentry, to observe what is going  on, and to make your profit of everything. I won't always have before  me a spy on all my affairs; a treacherous scamp, whose cursed eyes  watch all my actions, covet all I possess, and ferret about in every  corner to see if there is anything to steal. La Fl .  How the deuce could one steal anything from you? Are you a man  likely to be robbed when you put every possible thing under lock and  key, and mount guard day and night? Har .  I will lock up whatever I think fit, and mount guard when and  where I please. Did you ever see such spies as are set upon me to take  note of everything I do? ( Aside ) I tremble for fear he should  suspect something of my money. ( Aloud ) Now, aren't you a fellow  to give rise to stories about my having money hid in my house? La Fl .  You have some money hid in your house? Har .  No, scoundrel! I do not say that. ( Aside ) I am furious!  ( Aloud ) I only ask if out of mischief you do not spread abroad  the report that I have some? La Fl .  Oh! What does it matter whether you have money, or whether you  have not, since it is all the same to us? Har .  ( raising his hand to give La Flèche a blow ). Oh! oh! You  want to argue, do you? I will give you, and quickly too, some few of  these arguments about your ears. Get out of the house, I tell you once  more. La Fl .  Very well; very well. I am going. Har .  No, wait; are you carrying anything away with you? La Fl .  What can I possibly carry away? Har .  Come here, and let me see. Show me your hands. La Fl . There they are. Har . The others. La Fl . The others? Har . Yes. La Fl . There they are. Har .  ( pointing to La Flèche's breeches ).  Have you anything hid  in here? La Fl . Look for yourself. Har .  ( feeling the knees of the breeches ). These wide knee-breeches  are convenient receptacles of stolen goods; and I wish a pair  of them had been hanged. La Fl .  ( aside ). Ah! how richly such a man deserves what he  fears, and what joy it would be to me to steal some of his … Har . Eh? La Fl . What? Har . What is it you talk of stealing? La Fl .  I say that you feel about everywhere to see if I have been  stealing anything. Har .  And I mean to do so too. ( He feels in La Flèche's pockets ). La Fl .  Plague take all misers and all miserly ways! Har . Eh? What do you say? La Fl . What do I say? Har .  Yes. What is it you say about misers and miserly ways. La Fl .  I say plague take all misers and all miserly ways. Har . Of whom do you speak? La Fl . Of misers. Har . And who are they, these misers? La Fl . Villains and stingy wretches! Har . But what do you mean by that? La Fl .  Why do you trouble yourself so much about what I say? Har .  I trouble myself because I think it right to do so. La Fl .  Do you think I am speaking about you? Har .  I think what I think; but I insist upon your telling me to whom  you speak when you say that. La Fl .  To whom I speak? I am speaking to the inside of my hat. Har .  And I will, perhaps, speak to the outside of your head. La Fl .  Would you prevent me from cursing misers? Har .  No; but I will prevent you from prating and from being insolent.  Hold your tongue, will you? La Fl .  I name nobody. Har .  Another word, and I'll thrash you. La Fl .  He whom the cap fits, let him wear it. Har .  Will you be silent? La Fl .  Yes; much against my will. Har . Ah! ah! La Fl .  ( showing Harpagon one of his doublet pockets ).  Just look, here is one more pocket. Are you satisfied? Har .  Come, give it up to me without all that fuss. La Fl . Give you what? Har . What you have stolen from me. La Fl .  I have stolen nothing at all from you. Har . Are you telling the truth? La Fl . Yes. Har .  Good-bye, then, and now you may go to the devil. La Fl .  ( aside ). That's a nice way of dismissing anyone. Har .  I leave it to your conscience, remember! SCENE IV.——HARPAGON ( alone .) This rascally valet is a constant vexation to me; and I hate the very  sight of the good-for-nothing cripple. Really, it is no small anxiety  to keep by one a large sum of money; and happy is the man who has all  his cash well invested, and who needs not keep by him more than he  wants for his daily expenses. I am not a little puzzled to find in the  whole of this house a safe hiding-place. Don't speak to me of your  strong boxes, I will never trust to them. Why, they are just the very  things thieves set upon! SCENE V.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE and CLÉANTE are seen talking together at  the back of the stage . Har .  ( thinking himself alone .) Meanwhile, I hardly know whether  I did right to bury in my garden the ten thousand crowns which were  paid to me yesterday. Ten thousand crowns in gold is a sum  sufficiently … ( Aside, on perceiving Élise and Cléante whispering together ) Good heavens! I have betrayed myself; my  warmth has carried me away. I believe I spoke aloud while reasoning  with myself. ( To Cléante and Élise ) What do you want? Cle . Nothing, father. Har . Have you been here long? Eli . We have only just come. Har . Did you hear…? Cle . What, father? Har . There…! Cle . What? Har . What I was just now saying. Cle . No. Har . You did. I know you did. Eli .  I beg your pardon, father, but we did not. Har .  I see well enough that you overheard a few words. The fact is, I  was only talking to myself about the trouble one has nowadays to raise  any money; and I was saying that he is a fortunate man who has ten  thousand crowns in his house. Cle .  We were afraid of coming near you, for fear of intruding. Har .  I am very glad to tell you this, so that you may not misinterpret  things, and imagine that I said that it was I who have ten thousand  crowns. Cle .  We do not wish to interfere in your affairs. Har .  Would that I had them, these ten thousand crowns! Cle .  I should not think that … Har .  What a capital affair it would be for me. Cle . There are things … Har . I greatly need them. Cle . I fancy that … Har .  It would suit me exceedingly well. Eli . You are … Har .  And I should not have to complain, as I do now, that the times  are bad. Cle .  Hear me, father, you have no reason to complain; and everyone  knows that you are well enough off. Har .  How? I am well enough off! Those who say it are liars. Nothing  can be more false; and they are scoundrels who spread such reports. Eli . Don't be angry. Har .  It is strange that my own children betray me and become my  enemies. Cle .  Is it being your enemy to say that you have wealth? Har .  Yes, it is. Such talk and your extravagant expenses will be the  cause that some day thieves will come and cut my throat, in the belief  that I am made of gold. Cle .  What extravagant expenses do I indulge in? Har .  What! Is there anything more scandalous than this sumptuous  attire with which you jaunt it about the town? I was remonstrating  with your sister yesterday, but you are still worse. It cries  vengeance to heaven; and were we to calculate all you are wearing,  from head to foot, we should find enough for a good annuity. I have  told you a hundred times, my son, that your manners displease me  exceedingly; you affect the marquis terribly, and for you to be always  dressed as you are, you must certainly rob me. Cle .  Rob you? And how? Har .  How should I know? Where else could you find money enough to  clothe yourself as you do? Cle .  I, father? I play; and as I am very lucky, I spend in clothes all  the money I win. Har .  It is very wrong. If you are lucky at play, you should profit by  it, and place the money you win at decent interest, so that you may  find it again some day. I should like to know, for instance, without  mentioning the rest, what need there is for all these ribbons with  which you are decked from head to foot, and if half a dozen tags are  not sufficient to fasten your breeches. What necessity is there for  anyone to spend money upon wigs, when we have hair of our own growth,  which costs nothing. I will lay a wager that, in wigs and ribbons  alone, there are certainly twenty pistoles spent, and twenty pistoles  brings in at least eighteen livres six sous eight deniers per annum,  at only eight per cent interest. Cle . You are quite right. Har .  Enough on this subject; let us talk of something else. ( Aside,  noticing Cléante and Élise , who make signs to one another )  I believe they are making signs to one another to pick my pocket.  ( Aloud ) What do you mean by those signs? Eli .  We are hesitating as to who shall speak first, for we both have  something to tell you. Har .  And I also have something to tell you both. Cle .  We wanted to speak to you about marriage, father. Har .  The very thing I wish to speak to you about. Eli . Ah! my father! Har .  What is the meaning of that exclamation? Is it the word,  daughter, or the thing itself that frightens you? Cle .  Marriage may frighten us both according to the way you take it;  and our feelings may perhaps not coincide with your choice. Har .  A little patience, if you please. You need not be alarmed. I know  what is good for you both, and you will have no reason to complain of  anything I intend to do. To begin at the beginning. ( To Cléante )  Do you know, tell me, a young person, called Marianne, who  lives not far from here? Cle . Yes, father. Har . And you? Eli .  I have heard her spoken of. Har .  Well, my son, and how do you like the girl? Cle .  She is very charming. Har .  Her face? Cle . Modest and intelligent. Har . Her air and manner? Cle . Perfect, undoubtedly. Har .  Do you not think that such a girl well deserves to be thought of? Cle . Yes, father. Har .  She would form a very desirable match? Cle . Very desirable. Har .  That there is every likelihood of her making a thrifty and  careful wife. Cle . Certainly. Har .  And that a husband might live very happily with her? Cle .  I have not the least doubt about it. Har .  There is one little difficulty; I am afraid she has not the  fortune we might reasonably expect. Cle .  Oh, my father, riches are of little importance when one is sure  of marrying a virtuous woman. Har .  I beg your pardon. Only there is this to be said: that if we do  not find as much money as we could wish, we may make it up in  something else. Cle .  That follows as a matter of course. Har .  Well, I must say that I am very much pleased to find that you  entirely agree with me, for her modest manner and her gentleness have  won my heart; and I have made up my mind to marry her, provided I find  she has some dowry. Cle . Eh! Har . What now? Cle .  You are resolved, you say…? Har .  To marry Marianne. Cle . Who? you? you? Har .  Yes, I, I, I. What does all this mean? Cle .  I feel a sudden dizziness, and I must withdraw for a little  while. Har .  It will be nothing. Go quickly into the kitchen and drink a large  glass of cold water, it will soon set you all right again. SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE. Har .  There goes one of your effeminate fops, with no more stamina than  a chicken. That is what I have resolved for myself, my daughter. As to  your brother, I have thought for him of a certain widow, of whom I  heard this morning; and you I shall give to Mr. Anselme. Eli . To Mr. Anselme? Har .  Yes, a staid and prudent man, who is not above fifty, and of  whose riches everybody speaks. Eli . ( curtseying ).  I have no wish to marry, father, if you  please. Har . ( imitating Élise ).  And I, my little girl, my darling, I  wish you to marry, if you please. Eli .  ( curtseying again ). I beg your pardon, my father. Har .  ( again imitating Élise ).  I beg your pardon, my daughter. Eli .  I am the very humble servant of Mr. Anselme, but ( curtseying  again ), with your leave, I shall not marry him. Har .  I am your very humble servant, but ( again imitating Élise )  you will marry him this very evening. Eli . This evening? Har . This evening. Eli . ( curtseying again ).  It cannot be done, father. Har . ( imitating Élise ). It will be done, daughter. Eli . No. Har . Yes. Eli . No, I tell you. Har . Yes, I tell you. Eli .  You will never force me to do such a thing Har . I will force you to it. Eli .  I had rather kill myself than marry such a man. Har .  You will not kill yourself, and you will marry him. But did you  ever see such impudence? Did ever any one hear a daughter speak in  such a fashion to her father? Eli .  But did ever anyone see a father marry his daughter after such a  fashion? Har .  It is a match against which nothing can be said, and I am  perfectly sure that everybody will approve of my choice. Eli .  And I know that it will be approved of by no reasonable person. Har . ( seeing Valère ).  There is Valère coming. Shall we make him  judge in this affair? Eli . Willingly. Har .  You will abide by what he says? Eli .  Yes, whatever he thinks right, I will do. Har . Agreed. SCENE VII.——VALÈRE, HARPAGON, ÉLISE. Har .  Valère, we have chosen you to decide who is in the right, my  daughter or I. Val .  It is certainly you, Sir. Har .  But have you any idea of what we are talking about? Val .  No; but you could not be in the wrong; you are reason itself. Har .  I want to give her to-night, for a husband, a man as rich as he  is good; and the hussy tells me to my face that she scorns to take  him. What do you say to that? Val . What I say to it? Har . Yes? Val . Eh! eh! Har . What? Val .  I say that I am, upon the whole, of your opinion, and that you  cannot but be right; yet, perhaps, she is not altogether wrong;  and … Har .  How so? Mr. Anselme is an excellent match; he is a nobleman, and  a gentleman too; of simple habits, and extremely well off. He has no  children left from his first marriage. Could she meet with anything  more suitable? Val .  It is true. But she might say that you are going rather fast, and  that she ought to have at least a little time to consider whether her  inclination could reconcile itself to … Har .  It is an opportunity I must not allow to slip through my fingers.  I find an advantage here which I should not find elsewhere, and he  agrees to take her without dowry. Val . Without dowry? Har . Yes. Val .  Ah! I have nothing more to say. A more convincing reason could  not be found; and she must yield to that. Har .  It is a considerable saving to me. Val .  Undoubtedly; this admits of no contradiction. It is true that  your daughter might represent to you that marriage is a more serious  affair than people are apt to believe; that the happiness or misery of  a whole life depends on it, and that an engagement which is to last  till death ought not to be entered into without great consideration. Har . Without dowry! Val .  That must of course decide everything. There are certainly people  who might tell you that on such occasions the wishes of a daughter are  no doubt to be considered, and that this great disparity of age, of  disposition, and of feelings might be the cause of many an unpleasant  thing in a married life. Har . Without dowry! Val .  Ah! it must be granted that there is no reply to that; who in the  world could think otherwise? I do not mean to say but that there are  many fathers who would set a much higher value on the happiness of  their daughter than on the money they may have to give for their  marriage; who would not like to sacrifice them to their own interests,  and who would, above all things, try to see in a marriage that sweet  conformity of tastes which is a sure pledge of honour, tranquillity  and joy; and that … Har . Without dowry! Val .  That is true; nothing more can be said.  Without dowry. How can  anyone resist such arguments? Har .  ( aside, looking towards the garden ). Ah! I fancy I hear a  dog barking. Is anyone after my money.  ( To Valère ) Stop here,  I'll come back directly. SCENE VIII.——ÉLISE, VALÈRE. Eli .  Surely, Valère, you are not in earnest when you speak to him in  that manner? Val .  I do it that I may not vex him, and the better to secure my ends.  To resist him boldly would simply spoil everything. There are certain  people who are only to be managed by indirect means, temperaments  averse from all resistance, restive natures whom truth causes to rear,  who always kick when we would lead them on the right road of reason,  and who can only be led by a way opposed to that by which you wish  them to go. Pretend to comply with his wishes; you are much more  likely to succeed in the end, and … Eli .  But this marriage, Valère? Val .  We will find some pretext for breaking it off. Eli .  But what pretext can we find if it is to be concluded to-night? Val .  You must ask to have it delayed, and must feign some illness or  other. Eli .  But he will soon discover the truth if they call in the doctor. Val .  Not a bit of it. Do you imagine that a doctor understands what he  is about? Nonsense! Don't be afraid. Believe me, you may complain of  any disease you please, the doctor will be at no loss to explain to  you from what it proceeds. SCENE IX——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, VALÈRE. Har .  ( alone, at the farther end of the stage ). It is nothing,  thank heaven! Val .  ( not seeing Harpagon ).  In short, flight is the last  resource we have left us to avoid all this; and if your love, dear  Élise, is as strong as … ( Seeing Harpagon ) Yes, a daughter is  bound to obey her father. She has no right to inquire what a husband  offered to her is like, and when the most important question, \"without  dowry,\" presents itself, she should accept anybody that is given her. Har . Good; that was beautifully said! Val .  I beg your pardon, Sir, if I carry it a little too far, and take  upon myself to speak to her as I do. Har .  Why, I am delighted, and I wish you to have her entirely under  your control. ( To Élise )  Yes, you may run away as much as you  like. I give him all the authority over you that heaven has given me,  and I will have you do all that he tells you. Val .  After that, resist all my expostulations, if you can. SCENE X.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE. Val .  I will follow her, Sir, if you will allow me, and will continue  the lecture I was giving her. Har .  Yes, do so; you will oblige me greatly. Val .  She ought to be kept in with a tight hand. Har .  Quite true, you must … Val .  Do not be afraid; I believe I shall end by convincing her. Har .  Do so, do so. I am going to take a short stroll in the town, and  I will come back again presently. Val .  ( going towards the door through which Élise left, and  speaking as if it were to her ). Yes, money is more precious than  anything else in the world, and you should thank heaven that you have  so worthy a man for a father. He knows what life is. When a man offers  to marry a girl without a dowry, we ought to look no farther.  Everything is comprised in that, and \"without dowry\" compensates for  want of beauty, youth, birth, honour, wisdom, and probity. Har .  Ah! the honest fellow! he speaks like an oracle. Happy is he who  can secure such a servant! ACT II. SCENE I.——CLÉANTE, LA FLÈCHE. Cle .  How now, you rascal! where have you been hiding? Did I not give  you orders to…? La Fl .  Yes, Sir, and I came here resolved to wait for you without  stirring, but your father, that most ungracious of men, drove me into  the street in spite of myself, and I well nigh got a good drubbing  into the bargain. Cle .  How is our affair progressing? Things are worse than ever for us,  and since I left you, I have discovered that my own father is my  rival. La Fl . Your father in love? Cle .  It seems so; and I found it very difficult to hide from him what  I felt at such a discovery. La Fl .  He meddling with love! What the deuce is he thinking of? Does  he mean to set everybody at defiance? And is love made for people of  his build? Cle .  It is to punish me for my sins that this passion has entered his  head. La Fl .  But why do you hide your love from him? Cle .  That he may not suspect anything, and to make it more easy for me  to fall back, if need be, upon some device to prevent this marriage.  What answer did you receive? La Fl .  Indeed, Sir, those who borrow are much to be pitied, and we  must put up with strange things when, like you, we are forced to pass  through the hands of the usurers. Cle .  Then the affair won't come off? La Fl .  Excuse me; Mr. Simon, the broker who was recommended to us, is  a very active and zealous fellow, and says he has left no stone  unturned to help you. He assures me that your looks alone have won his  heart. Cle .  Shall I have the fifteen thousand francs which I want? La Fl .  Yes, but under certain trifling conditions, which you must  accept if you wish the bargain to be concluded. Cle .  Did you speak to the man who is to lend the money? La Fl .  Oh! dear no. Things are not done in that way. He is still more  anxious than you to remain unknown. These things are greater mysteries  than you think. His name is not by any means to be divulged, and he is  to be introduced to you to-day at a house provided by him, so that he  may hear from yourself all about your position and your family; and I  have not the least doubt that the mere name of your father will be  sufficient to accomplish what you wish. Cle .  Particularly as my mother is dead, and they cannot deprive me of  what I inherit from her. La Fl .  Well, here are some of the conditions which he has himself  dictated to our go-between for you to take cognisance of, before  anything is begun. \"Supposing that the lender is satisfied with all his securities, and  that the borrower is of age and of a family whose property is ample,  solid, secure, and free from all incumbrances, there shall be drawn up  a good and correct bond before as honest a notary as it is possible to  find, and who for this purpose shall be chosen by the lender, because  he is the more concerned of the two that the bond should be rightly  executed.\" Cle . There is nothing to say against that. LA FA. \"The lender, not to burden his conscience with the least  scruple, does not wish to lend his money at more than five and a half  per cent.\" Cle .  Five and a half per cent? By Jove, that's honest! We have nothing  to complain of. La Fl . That's true. \"But as the said lender has not in hand the sum required, and as, in  order to oblige the borrower, he is himself obliged to borrow from  another at the rate of twenty per cent., it is but right that the said  first borrower shall pay this interest, without detriment to the rest;  since it is only to oblige him that the said lender is himself forced  to borrow.\" Cle .  The deuce! What a Jew! what a Turk we have here! That is more  than twenty-five per cent. La Fl .  That's true; and it is the remark I made. It is for you to  consider the matter before you act. Cle .  How can I consider? I want the money, and I must therefore accept  everything. La Fl .  That is exactly what I answered. Cle . Is there anything else? La Fl . Only a small item. \"Of the fifteen thousand francs which are demanded, the lender will  only be able to count down twelve thousand in hard cash; instead of  the remaining three thousand, the borrower will have to take the  chattels, clothing, and jewels, contained in the following catalogue,  and which the said lender has put in all good faith at the lowest  possible figure.\" Cle .   What is the meaning of all that? La Fl .  I'll go through the catalogue:— \"Firstly:—A fourpost bedstead, with hangings of Hungary lace very  elegantly trimmed with olive-coloured cloth, and six chairs and a  counterpane to match; the whole in very good condition, and lined with  soft red and blue shot-silk. Item:—the tester of good pale pink  Aumale serge, with the small and the large fringes of silk.\" Cle . What does he want me to do with all this? La Fl . Wait. \"Item:—Tapestry hangings representing the loves of Gombaud and  Macée. 1 Item:—A large walnut table with  twelve columns or turned legs, which draws out at both ends, and is  provided beneath with six stools.\" Cle .  Hang it all! What am I to do with all this? La Fl .  Have patience. \"Item:—Three large matchlocks inlaid with mother-of-pearl, with rests  to correspond. Item:—A brick furnace with two retorts and three  receivers, very useful to those who have any taste for distilling.\" Cle . You will drive me crazy. La Fl . Gently! \"Item:—A Bologna lute with all its strings, or nearly all. Item:—A  pigeon-hole table and a draught-board, and a game of mother goose,  restored from the Greeks, most useful to pass the time when one has  nothing to do. Item:—A lizard's skin, three feet and a half in  length, stuffed with hay, a pleasing curiosity to hang on the ceiling  of a room. The whole of the above-mentioned articles are really worth  more than four thousand five hundred francs, and are reduced to the  value of a thousand crowns through the considerateness of the lender.\" Cle .  Let the plague choke him with his considerateness, the wretch,  the cut-throat that he is! Did ever anyone hear of such usury? Is he  not satisfied with the outrageous interest he asks that he must force  me to take, instead of the three thousand francs, all the old rubbish  which he picks up. I shan't get two hundred crowns for all that, and  yet I must bring myself to yield to all his wishes; for he is in a  position to force me to accept everything, and he has me, the villain,  with a knife at my throat. La Fl .  I see you, Sir, if you'll forgive my saying so, on the high-road  followed by Panurge 2 to  ruin himself—taking money in advance, buying dear, selling cheap,  and cutting your corn while it is still grass. Cle .  What would you have me do? It is to this that young men are  reduced by the accursed avarice of their fathers; and people are  astonished after that, that sons long for their death. La Fl .  No one can deny that yours would excite against his meanness  the most quiet of men. I have not, thank God, any inclination gallows-  ward, and among my colleagues whom I see dabbling in various doubtful  affairs, I know well enough how to keep myself out of hot water, and  how to keep clear of all those things which savour ever so little of  the ladder; but to tell you the truth, he almost gives me, by his ways  of going on, the desire of robbing him, and I should think that in  doing so I was doing a meritorious action. Cle .  Give me that memorandum that I may have another look at it. SCENE II.——HARPAGON, MR. SIMON  (CLÉANTE and LA FLÈCHE at the  back of the stage ). Sim .  Yes, Sir; it is a young man who is greatly in want of money; his  affairs force him to find some at any cost, and he will submit to all  your conditions. Har .  But are you sure, Mr. Simon, that there is no risk to run in this  case? and do you know the name, the property, and the family of him  for whom you speak? Sim .  No; I cannot tell you anything for certain, as it was by mere  chance that I was made acquainted with him; but he will tell you  everything himself, and his servant has assured me that you will be  quite satisfied when you know who he is. All I can tell you is that  his family is said to be very wealthy, that he has already lost his  mother, and that he will pledge you his word, if you insist upon it,  that his father will die before eight months are passed. Har .  That is something. Charity, Mr. Simon, demands of us to gratify  people whenever we have it in our power. Sim . Evidently. La Fl . ( aside to Cléante , on recognising Mr. Simon ).  What does this mean? Mr. Simon talking with your father! Cle . ( aside to La Flèche ).  Has he been told who I am, and would  you be capable of betraying me? Sim . ( to Cléante and La Flèche ). Ah! you are in good  time! But who told you to come here? ( To Harpagon ) It was  certainly not I who told them your name and address; but I am of  opinion that there is no great harm done; they are people who can be  trusted, and you can come to some understanding together. Har . What! Sim . ( showing Cléante ). This is the gentleman who wants to  borrow the fifteen thousand francs of which I have spoken to you. Har .  What! miscreant! is it you who abandon yourself to such excesses? Cle .  What! father! is it you who stoop to such shameful deeds? ( M. Simon runs away, and La Flèche hides himself .) SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE. Har .  It is you who are ruining yourself by loans so greatly to be  condemned! Cle .  So it is you who seek to enrich yourself by such criminal usury! Har .  And you dare, after that, to show yourself before me? Cle .  And you dare, after that, to show yourself to the world? Har .  Are you not ashamed, tell me, to descend to these wild excesses,  to rush headlong into frightful expenses, and disgracefully to  dissipate the wealth which your parents have amassed with so much  toil. Cle .  Are you not ashamed of dishonouring your station by such  dealings, of sacrificing honour and reputation to the insatiable  desire of heaping crown upon crown, and of outdoing the most infamous  devices that have ever been invented by the most notorious usurers? Har .  Get out of my sight, you reprobate; get out of my sight! Cle .  Who is the more criminal in your opinion: he who buys the money  of which he stands in need, or he who obtains, by unfair means, money  for which he has no use? Har .  Begone, I say, and do not provoke me to anger. ( Alone )  After all, I am not very much vexed at this adventure; it will be a  lesson to me to keep a better watch over all his doings. SCENE IV.——FROSINE, HARPAGON. Fro . Sir. Har .  Wait a moment, I will come back and speak to you. ( Aside )  I had better go and see a little after my money. SCENE V.——LA FLÈCHE, FROSINE. La Fl . ( without seeing Frosine ). The adventure is most comical.  Hidden somewhere he must have a large store of goods of all kinds, for  the list did not contain one single article which either of us  recognised. Fro .  Hallo! is it you, my poor La Flèche? How is it we meet here? La Fl .  Ah! ah! it is you, Frosine; and what have you come to do here? Fro .  What have I come to do? Why! what I do everywhere else, busy  myself about other people's affairs, make myself useful to the  community in general, and profit as much as I possibly can by the  small talent I possess. Must we not live by our wits in this world?  and what other resources have people like me but intrigue and cunning? La Fl .  Have you, then, any business with the master of this house? Fro .  Yes. I am transacting for him a certain small matter for which he  is pretty sure to give me a reward. La Fl .  He give you a reward! Ah! ah! Upon my word, you will be 'cute  if you ever get one, and I warn you that ready money is very scarce  hereabouts. Fro .  That may be, but there are certain services which wonderfully  touch our feelings. La Fl .  Your humble servant; but as yet you don't know Harpagon.  Harpagon is the human being of all human beings the least humane, the  mortal of all mortals the hardest and closest. There is no service  great enough to induce him to open his purse. If, indeed, you want  praise, esteem, kindness, and friendship, you are welcome to any  amount; but money, that's a different affair. There is nothing more  dry, more barren, than his favour and his good grace, and  \" give \" is a word for which he has such a strong dislike that he  never says I give , but I lend, you a good morning . Fro .  That's all very well; but I know the art of fleecing men. I have  a secret of touching their affections by flattering their hearts, and  of finding out their weak points. La Fl .  All useless here. I defy you to soften, as far as money is  concerned, the man we are speaking of. He is a Turk on that point, of  a Turkishness to drive anyone to despair, and we might starve in his  presence and never a peg would he stir. In short, he loves money  better than reputation, honour, and virtue, and the mere sight of  anyone making demands upon his purse sends him into convulsions; it is  like striking him in a vital place, it is piercing him to the heart,  it is like tearing out his very bowels! And if … But here he comes  again; I leave you. SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, FROSINE. Har . ( aside ). All is as it should be.  ( To Frosine ) Well,  what is it, Frosine? Fro .  Bless me, how well you look! You are the very picture of health. Har . Who? I? Fro .  Never have I seen you looking more rosy, more hearty. Har . Are you in earnest? Fro .  Why! you have never been so young in your life; and I know many a  man of twenty-five who looks much older than you do. Har .  And yet, Frosine, I have passed threescore. Fro .  Threescore! Well, and what then? You don't mean to make a trouble  of that, do you? It's the very flower of manhood, the threshold of the  prime of life. Har .  True; but twenty years less would do me no harm, I think. Fro .  Nonsense! You've no need of that, and you are of a build to last  out a hundred. Har .  Do you really think so? Fro .  Decidedly. You have all the appearance of it. Hold yourself up a  little. Ah! what a sign of long life is that line there straight  between your two eyes! Har .  You know all about that, do you? Fro .  I should think I do. Show me your hand. 3 Dear me, what a line of life there is there! Har . Where? Fro .  Don't you see how far this line goes? Har .  Well, and what does it mean? Fro .  What does it mean? There … I said a hundred years; but no, it  is one hundred and twenty I ought to have said. Har . Is it possible? Fro .  I tell you they will have to kill you, and you will bury your  children and your children's children. Har .  So much the better! And what news of our affair? Fro .  Is there any need to ask? Did ever anyone see me begin anything  and not succeed in it? I have, especially for matchmaking, the most  wonderful talent. There are no two persons in the world I could not  couple together; and I believe that, if I took it into my head, I  could make the Grand Turk marry the Republic of  Venice. 4 But we had,  to be sure, no such difficult thing to  achieve in this matter. As I know the ladies very well, I told them  every particular about you; and I acquainted the mother with your  intentions towards Marianne since you saw her pass in the street and  enjoy the fresh air out of her window. Har . What did she answer…? Fro .  She received your proposal with great joy; and when I told her  that you wished very much that her daughter should come to-night to  assist at the marriage contract which is to be signed for your own  daughter, she assented at once, and entrusted her to me for the  purpose. Har .  You see, Frosine, I am obliged to give some supper to Mr.  Anselme, and I should like her to have a share in the feast. Fro .  You are quite right. She is to come after dinner to pay a visit  to your daughter; then she means to go from here to the fair, and  return to your house just in time for supper. Har .  That will do very well; they shall go together in my carriage,  which I will lend them. Fro .  That will suit her perfectly. Har .  But I say, Frosine, have you spoken to the mother about the dowry  she can give her daughter? Did you make her understand that under such  circumstances she ought to do her utmost and to make a great  sacrifice? For, after all, one does not marry a girl without her  bringing something with her. Fro .  How something! She is a girl who will bring you a clear twelve  thousand francs a year? Har . Twelve thousand francs a year? Fro .  Yes! To begin with, she has been nursed and brought up with the  strictest notions of frugality. She is a girl accustomed to live upon  salad, milk, cheese, and apples, and who consequently will require  neither a well served up table, nor any rich broth, nor your  everlasting peeled barley; none, in short, of all those delicacies  that another woman would want. This is no small matter, and may well  amount to three thousand francs yearly. Besides this, she only cares  for simplicity and neatness; she will have none of those splendid  dresses and rich jewels, none of that sumptuous furniture in which  girls like her indulge so extravagantly; and this item is worth more  than four thousand francs per annum. Lastly, she has the deepest  aversion to gambling; and this is not very common nowadays among  women. Why, I know of one in our neighbourhood who lost at least  twenty thousand francs this year. But let us reckon only a fourth of  that sum. Five thousand francs a year at play and four thousand in  clothes and jewels make nine thousand; and three thousand francs which  we count for food, does it not make your twelve thousand francs? Har .  Yes, that's not bad; but, after all, that calculation has nothing  real in it. Fro .  Excuse me; is it nothing real to bring you in marriage a great  sobriety, to inherit a great love for simplicity in dress, and the  acquired property of a great hatred for gambling? Har .  It is a farce to pretend to make up a dowry with all the expenses  she will not run into. I could not give a receipt for what I do not  receive; and I must decidedly get something. Fro .  Bless me! you will get enough; and they have spoken to me of a  certain country where they have some property, of which you will be  master. Har .  We shall have to see to that. But, Frosine, there is one more  thing that makes me uneasy. The girl is young, you know; and young  people generally like those who are young like themselves, and only  care for the society of the young. I am afraid that a man of my age  may not exactly suit her taste, and that this may occasion in my  family certain complications that would in nowise be pleasant to me. Fro .  Oh, how badly you judge her! This is one more peculiarity of  which I had to speak to you. She has the greatest detestation to all  young men, and only likes old people. Har . Does she? Fro .  I should like you to hear her talk on that subject; she cannot  bear at all the sight of a young man, and nothing delights her more  than to see a fine old man with a venerable beard. The oldest are to  her the most charming, and I warn you beforehand not to go and make  yourself any younger than you really are. She wishes for one sixty  years old at least; and it is not more than six months ago that on the  very eve of being married she suddenly broke off the match on learning  that her lover was only fifty-six years of age, and did not put on  spectacles to sign the contract. Har . Only for that? Fro .  Yes; she says there is no pleasure with a man of fifty-six; and  she has a decided affection for those who wear spectacles. Har . Well, this is quite new to me. Fro .  No one can imagine how far she carries this. She has in her room  a few pictures and engravings, and what do you imagine they are? An  Adonis, a Cephalus, a Paris, an Apollo? Not a bit of it! Fine  portraits of Saturn, of King Priam, of old Nestor, and of good father  Anchises on his son's shoulders. Har .  That's admirable. I should never have guessed such a thing; and I  am very pleased to hear that she has such taste as this. Indeed had I  been a woman, I should never have loved young fellows. Fro .  I should think not. Fine trumpery indeed, these young men, for  any one to fall in love with. Fine jackanapes and puppies for a woman  to hanker after. I should like to know what relish anyone can find in  them? Har .  Truly; I don't understand it myself, and I cannot make out how it  is that some women dote so on them. Fro .  They must be downright idiots. Can any one be in his senses who  thinks youth amiable? Can those curly-pated coxcombs be men, and can  one really get attached to such animals? Har .  Exactly what I say every day! With their effeminate voices, their  three little bits of a beard turned up like cat's whiskers, their tow  wigs, their flowing breeches and open breasts! Fro .  Yes; they are famous guys compared with yourself. In you we see  something like a man. There is enough to satisfy the eye. It is thus  that one should be made and dressed to inspire love. Har . Then you think I am pretty well? Fro .  Pretty well! I should think so; you are charming, and your face  would make a beautiful picture. Turn round a little, if you please.  You could not find anything better anywhere. Let me see you walk. You  have a well-shaped body, free and easy, as it should be, and one which  gives no sign of infirmity. Har .  I have nothing the matter to speak of, I am thankful to say. It  is only my cough, which returns from time to  time. 5 Fro .  That is nothing, and coughing becomes you exceedingly well. Har .  Tell me, Frosine, has Marianne seen me yet? Has she not noticed  me when I passed by? Fro .  No; but we have had many conversations about you. I gave her an  exact description of your person, and I did not fail to make the most  of your merit, and to show her what an advantage it would be to have a  husband like you. Har .  You did right, and I thank you very much for it. Fro .  I have, Sir, a small request to make to you. I am in danger of  losing a lawsuit for want of a little money  ( Harpagon looks  grave ), and you can easily help me with it, if you have pity upon  me. You cannot imagine how happy she will be to see you.  ( Harpagon looks joyful .) Oh! how sure you are to please her, and how sure  that antique ruff of yours is to produce a wonderful effect on her  mind. But, above all, she will be delighted with your breeches  fastened to your doublet with tags; that will make her mad after you,  and a lover who wears tags will be most welcome to her. Har .  You send me into raptures, Frosine, by saying that. Fro .  I tell you the truth, Sir; this lawsuit is of the utmost  importance for me. ( Harpagon looks serious again .) If I lose  it, I am for ever ruined; but a very small sum will save me. I should  like you to have seen the happiness she felt when I spoke of you to  her. ( Harpagon looks pleased again .)  Joy sparkled in her eyes  while I told her of all your good qualities; and I succeeded, in  short, in making her look forward with the greatest impatience to the  conclusion of the match. Har .  You have given me great pleasure, Frosine, and I assure you I … Fro .  I beg of you, Sir, to grant me the little assistance I ask of  you. ( Harpagon again looks grave .)  It will put me on my feet  again, and I shall feel grateful to you for ever. Har .  Good-bye; I must go and finish my correspondence. Fro .  I assure you, Sir, that you could not help me in a more pressing  necessity. Har .  I will see that my carriage is ready to take you to the fair. Fro .  I would not importune you so if I were not compelled by  necessity. Har .  And I will see that we have supper early, so that nobody may be  ill. Fro .  Do not refuse me the service; I beg of you. You can hardly  believe, Sir, the pleasure that … Har .  I must go; somebody is calling me. We shall see each other again  by and by. Fro . ( alone ).  May the fever seize you, you stingy cur, and send  you to the devil and his angels! The miser has held out against all my  attacks; but I must not drop the negotiation; for I have the other  side, and there, at all events, I am sure of a good reward. ACT III. SCENE I.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, VALÈRE,  DAME CLAUDE ( holding a  broom ), MASTER JACQUES, LA MERLUCHE, BRINDAVOINE. Har .  Here, come here, all of you; I must give you orders for by and  by, and arrange what each one will have to do. Come nearer, Dame  Claude; let us begin with you. ( Looking at her broom. ) Good;  you are ready armed, I see. To you I commit the care of cleaning up  everywhere; but, above all, be very careful not to rub the furniture  too hard, for fear of wearing it out. Besides this, I put the bottles  under your care during supper, and if any one of them is missing, or  if anything gets broken, you will be responsible for it, and pay it  out of your wages. Jac .  ( aside ). A shrewd punishment that. Har . ( to Dame Claude .) Now you may go. SCENE II.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE,  ÉLISE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES,  BRINDAVOINE, LA MERLUCHE. Har .  To you, Brindavoine, and to you, La Merluche, belongs the duty of  washing the glasses, and of giving to drink, but only when people are  thirsty, and not according to the custom of certain impertinent  lackeys, who urge them to drink, and put the idea into their heads  when they are not thinking about it. Wait until you have been asked  several times, and remember always to have plenty of water. Jac . ( aside ).  Yes; wine without water gets into one's head. La Mer .  Shall we take off our smocks, Sir? Har .  Yes, when you see the guests coming; but be very careful not to  spoil your clothes. Brind .  You know, Sir, that one of the fronts of my doublet is covered  with a large stain of oil from the lamp. La Mer .  And I, Sir, that my breeches are all torn behind, and that,  saving your presence … Har . ( to La Merluche ).  Peace! Turn carefully towards the wall,  and always face the company. ( To Brindavoine , showing him  how he is to hold his hat before his doublet, to hide the stain of  oil ) And you, always hold your hat in this fashion when you wait  on the guests. SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE,  ÉLISE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Har .  As for you, my daughter, you will look after all that is cleared  off the table, and see that nothing is wasted: this care is very  becoming to young girls. Meanwhile get ready to welcome my lady-love,  who is coming this afternoon to pay you a visit, and will take you off  to the fair with her. Do you understand what I say? Eli . Yes, father. SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE,  VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Har .  And you, my young dandy of a son to whom I have the kindness of  forgiving what happened this morning, mind you don't receive her  coldly, or show her a sour face. Cle .  Receive her coldly! And why should I? Har .  Why? why? We know pretty well the ways of children whose fathers  marry again, and the looks they give to those we call stepmothers. But  if you wish me to forget your last offence, I advise you, above all  things, to receive her kindly, and, in short, to give her the  heartiest welcome you can. Cle .  To speak the truth, father, I cannot promise you that I am very  happy to see her become my stepmother; but as to receiving her  properly, and as to giving her a kind welcome, I promise to obey you  in that to the very letter. Har .  Be careful you do, at least. Cle .  You will see that you have no cause to complain. Har . You will do wisely. SCENE V.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Har .  Valère, you will have to give me your help in this business. Now,  Master Jacques, I kept you for the last. Jac .  Is it to your coachman, Sir, or to your cook you want to speak,  for I am both the one and the other? Har . To both. Jac .  But to which of the two first? Har . To the cook. Jac .  Then wait a minute, if you please. ( Jacques takes off his stable-coat and appears dressed as a  cook. ) Har .  What the deuce is the meaning of this ceremony? Jac . Now I am at your service. Har .  I have engaged myself, Master Jacques, to give a supper to-night. Jac . ( aside ). Wonderful! Har . Tell me, can you give us a good supper? Jac . Yes, if you give me plenty of money. Har .  The deuce! Always money! I think they have nothing else to say  except money, money, money! Always that same word in their mouth,  money! They always speak of money! It's their pillow companion, money! Val .  Never did I hear such an impertinent answer! Would you call it  wonderful to provide good cheer with plenty of money? Is it not the  easiest thing in the world? The most stupid could do as much. But a  clever man should talk of a good supper with little money. Jac .  A good supper with little money? Val . Yes. Jac .  ( to Valère ).  Indeed, Mr. Steward, you will oblige me  greatly by telling me your secret, and also, if you like, by filling  my place as cook; for you keep on meddling here, and want to be  everything. Har .  Hold your tongue. What shall we want? Jac .  Ask that of Mr. Steward, who will give you good cheer with little  money. Har .  Do you hear? I am speaking to you, and expect you to answer me. Jac .  How many will there be at your table? Har .  Eight or ten; but you must only reckon for eight. When there is  enough for eight, there is enough for ten. Val . That is evident. Jac .  Very well, then; you must have four tureens of soup and five side  dishes; soups, entrées … Har .  What! do you mean to feed a whole town? Jac . Roast … Har . ( clapping his hand on Master Jacques' mouth ). Ah!  Wretch! you are eating up all my substance. Jac . Entremêts … Har . ( again putting his hand on Jacques' mouth ). More  still? Val . ( to Jacques ).  Do you mean to kill everybody? And has your  master invited people in order to destroy them with over-feeding? Go  and read a little the precepts of health, and ask the doctors if there  is anything so hurtful to man as excess in eating. Har . He is perfectly right. Val .  Know, Master Jacques, you and people like you, that a table  overloaded with eatables is a real cut-throat; that, to be the true  friends of those we invite, frugality should reign throughout the  repast we give, and that according to the saying of one of the  ancients, \"We must eat to live, and not live to eat.\" Har .  Ah! How well the man speaks! Come near, let me embrace you for  this last saying. It is the finest sentence that I have ever heard in  my life: \"We must live to eat, and not eat to live.\" No; that isn't  it. How do you say it? Val .  That we must eat to live, and not live to eat. Har .  ( to Master Jacques ).  Yes. Do you hear that? ( To Valère )  Who is the great man who said that? Val .  I do not exactly recollect his name just now. Har .  Remember to write down those words for me. I will have them  engraved in letters of gold over the mantel-piece of my dining-room. Val .  I will not fail. As for your supper, you had better let me manage  it. I will see that it is all as it should be. Har . Do so. Jac .  So much the better; all the less work for me. Har . ( to Valère ).  We must have some of those things of which it  is not possible to eat much, and that satisfy directly. Some good fat  beans, and a pâté well stuffed with chestnuts. Val . Trust to me. Har .  Now, Master Jacques, you must clean my carriage. Jac . Wait a moment; this is to the coachman.  ( Jacques puts on his  coat. ) You say … Har .  That you must clean my carriage, and have my horses ready to  drive to the fair. Jac .  Your horses! Upon my word, Sir, they are not at all in a  condition to stir. I won't tell you that they are laid up, for the  poor things have got nothing to lie upon, and it would not be telling  the truth. But you make them keep such rigid fasts that they are  nothing but phantoms, ideas, and mere shadows of horses. Har .  They are much to be pitied. They have nothing to do. Jac .  And because they have nothing to do, must they have nothing to  eat? It would be much better for them, poor things, to work much and  eat to correspond. It breaks my heart to see them so reduced; for, in  short, I love my horses; and when I see them suffer, it seems as if it  were myself. Every day I take the bread out of my own mouth to feed  them; and it is being too hard-hearted, Sir, to have no compassion  upon one's neighbour. Har .  It won't be very hard work to go to the fair. Jac .  No, Sir. I haven't the heart to drive them; it would go too much  against my conscience to use the whip to them in the state they are  in. How could you expect them to drag a carriage? They have not even  strength enough to drag themselves along. Val .  Sir, I will ask our neighbour, Picard, to drive them;  particularly as we shall want his help to get the supper ready. Jac .  Be it so. I had much rather they should die under another's hand  than under mine. Val .  Master Jacques is mightily considerate. Jac .  Mr. Steward is mightily indispensable. Har . Peace. Jac .  Sir, I can't bear these flatteries, and I can see that, whatever  this man does, his continual watching after the bread, wine, wood,  salt, and candles, is done but to curry favour and to make his court  to you. I am indignant to see it all; and I am sorry to hear every day  what is said of you; for, after all, I have a certain tenderness for  you; and, except my horses, you are the person I like most in the  world. Har .  And I would know from you, Master Jacques, what it is that is  said of me. Jac .  Yes, certainly, Sir, if I were sure you would not get angry with  me. Har .  No, no; never fear. Jac .  Excuse me, but I am sure you will be angry. Har .  No, on the contrary, you will oblige me. I should be glad to know  what people say of me. Jac .  Since you wish it, Sir, I will tell you frankly that you are the  laughing-stock of everybody; that they taunt us everywhere by a  thousand jokes on your account, and that nothing delights people more  than to make sport of you, and to tell stories without end about your  stinginess. One says that you have special almanacks printed, where  you double the ember days and vigils, so that you may profit by the  fasts to which you bind all your house; another, that you always have  a ready-made quarrel for your servants at Christmas time or when they  leave you, so that you may give them nothing. One tells a story how  not long since you prosecuted a neighbour's cat because it had eaten  up the remainder of a leg of mutton; another says that one night you  were caught stealing your horses' oats, and that your coachman,—that  is the man who was before me,—gave you, in the dark, a good sound  drubbing, of which you said nothing. In short, what is the use of  going on? We can go nowhere but we are sure to hear you pulled to  pieces. You are the butt and jest and byword of everybody; and never  does anyone mention you but under the names of miser, stingy, mean,  niggardly fellow and usurer. Har . ( beating Jacques ). You are a fool, a rascal, a scoundrel,  and an impertinent wretch. Jac .  There, there! Did not I know how it would be? You would not  believe me. I told you I should make you angry if I spoke the truth? Har . Learn how to speak. SCENE VI.——VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Val . ( laughing ).  Well, Master Jacques, your frankness is badly  rewarded, I fear. Jac .  S'death! Mr. Upstart, you who assume the man of consequence, it  is no business of yours as far as I can see. Laugh at your own  cudgelling when you get it, and don't come here and laugh at mine. Val .  Ah! Master Jacques, don't get into a passion, I beg of you. Jac . ( aside ).  He is drawing in his horns. I will put on a bold  face, and if he is fool enough to be afraid of me, I will pay him back  somewhat. ( To Valère )  Do you know, Mr. Grinner, that I am not  exactly in a laughing humour, and that if you provoke me too much, I  shall make you laugh after another fashion.  ( Jacques pushes Valère to the farther end of the stage, threatening him. ) Val .  Gently, gently. Jac .  How gently? And if it does not please me to go gently? Val .  Come, come! What are you about? Jac .  You are an impudent rascal. Val .  Master Jacques … Jac .  None of your Master Jacques here! If I take up a stick, I shall  soon make you feel it. Val .  What do you mean by a stick? ( Drives back Jacques in  his turn. ) Jac .  No; I don't say anything about that. Val .  Do you know, Mr. Conceit, that I am a man to give you a drubbing  in good earnest? Jac .  I have no doubt of it. Val .  That, after all, you are nothing but a scrub of a cook? Jac . I know it very well. Val .  And that you don't know me yet? Jac . I beg your pardon. Val .  You will beat me, you say? Jac . I only spoke in jest. Val .  I don't like your jesting, and ( beating Jacques ) remember  that you are but a sorry hand at it. Jac . ( alone ).  Plague take all sincerity; it is a bad trade. I  give it up for the future, and will cease to tell the truth. It is all  very well for my master to beat me; but as for that Mr. Steward, what  right has he to do it? I will be revenged on him if I can. SCENE VII.——MARIANNE, FROSINE, MASTER JACQUES. Fro .  Do you know if your master is at home? Jac .  Yes, he is indeed; I know it but too well. Fro .  Tell him, please, that we are here. SCENE VIII.——MARIANNE, FROSINE. Mar .  Ah! Frosine, how strange I feel, and how I dread this interview! Fro .  Why should you? What can you possibly dread? Mar .  Alas! can you ask me? Can you not understand the alarms of a  person about to see the instrument of torture to which she is to be  tied. Fro .  I see very well that to die agreeably, Harpagon is not the  torture you would embrace; and I can judge by your looks that the fair  young man you spoke of to me is still in your thoughts. Mar .  Yes, Frosine; it is a thing I do not wish to deny. The respectful  visits he has paid at our house have left, I confess, a great  impression on my heart. Fro .  But do you know who he is? Mar .  No, I do not. All I know is that he is made to be loved; that if  things were left to my choice, I would much rather marry him than any  other, and that he adds not a little to the horrible dread that I have  of the husband they want to force upon me. Fro .  Oh yes! All those dandies are very pleasant, and can talk  agreeably enough, but most of them are as poor as church mice; and it  is much better for you to marry an old husband, who gives you plenty  of money. I fully acknowledge that the senses somewhat clash with the  end I propose, and that there are certain little inconveniences to be  endured with such a husband; but all that won't last; and his death,  believe me, will soon put you in a position to take a more pleasant  husband, who will make amends for all. Mar .  Oh, Frosine! What a strange state of things that, in order to be  happy, we must look forward to the death of another. Yet death will  not fall in with all the projects we make. Fro .  You are joking. You marry him with the express understanding that  he will soon leave you a widow; it must be one of the articles of the  marriage contract. It would be very wrong in him not to die before  three months are over. Here he is himself. Mar . Ah! dear Frosine, what a face! SCENE IX.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, FROSINE. Har . ( to Marianne ). Do not be offended, fair one, if I come to  you with my glasses on. I know that your beauty is great enough to be  seen with the naked eye; but, still, it is with glasses that we look  at the stars, and I maintain and uphold that you are a star, the most  beautiful and in the land of stars. Frosine, she does not answer,  star, it seems to me, shows no joy at the sight of me. Fro .  It is because she is still quite awe-struck, and young girls are  always shy at first, and afraid of showing what they feel. Har .  ( to Frosine ). You are right.  ( To Marianne ) My  pretty darling, there is my daughter coming to welcome you. SCENE X.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, FROSINE. Mar .  I am very late in acquitting myself of the visit I owed you. Eli .  You have done what I ought to have done. It was for me to have  come and seen you first. Har .  You see what a great girl she is; but ill weeds grow apace. Mar . ( aside to Frosine ). Oh, what an unpleasant man! Har . ( to Frosine ). What does my fair one say? Fro . That she thinks you perfect. Har .  You do me too much honour, my adorable darling. Mar .  ( aside ). What a dreadful creature! Har .  I really feel too grateful to you for these sentiments. Mar . ( aside ). I can bear it no longer. SCENE XI.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE,  VALÈRE, FROSINE, BRINDAVOINE. Har .  Here is my son, who also comes to pay his respects to you. Mar .  ( aside to Frosine ).  Oh, Frosine! what a strange meeting!  He is the very one of whom I spoke to you. Fro . ( to Marianne ). Well, that is extraordinary. Har .  You are surprised to see that my children can be so old; but I  shall soon get rid of both of them. Cle . ( to Marianne ). Madam, to tell you the truth, I little  expected such an event; and my father surprised me not a little when  he told me to-day of the decision he had come to. Mar .  I can say the same thing. It is an unexpected meeting; and I  certainly was far from being prepared for such an event. Cle .  Madam, my father cannot make a better choice, and it is a great  joy to me to have the honour of welcoming you here. At the same time,  I cannot say that I should rejoice if it were your intention to become  my stepmother. I must confess that I should find it difficult to pay  you the compliment; and it is a title, forgive me, that I cannot wish  you to have. To some this speech would seem coarse, but I feel that  you understand it. This marriage, Madam, is altogether repugnant to  me. You are not ignorant, now that you know who I am, how opposed it  is to all my own interests, and with my father's permission I hope you  will allow me to say that, if things depended on me, it would never  take place. Har . ( aside ).  What a very impertinent speech to make; and what  a confession to make to her! Mar .  And as my answer, I must tell you that things are much the same  with me, and that, if you have any repugnance in seeing me your  stepmother, I shall have no less in seeing you my stepson. Do not  believe, I beg of you, that it is of my own will that this trouble has  come upon you. I should be deeply grieved to cause you the least  sorrow, and unless I am forced to it by a power I must obey, I give  you my word that, I will never consent to a marriage which is so  painful to you. Har .  She is right. A foolish speech deserves a foolish answer. I beg  your pardon, my love, for the impertinence of my son. He is a silly  young fellow, who has not yet learnt the value of his own words. Mar .  I assure you that he has not at all offended me. I am thankful,  on the contrary, that he has spoken so openly. I care greatly for such  a confession from him, and if he had spoken differently, I should feel  much less esteem for him. Har .  It is very kind of you to excuse him thus. Time will make him  wiser, and you will see that his feelings will change. Cle .  No, father, they will never change; and I earnestly beg of you,  Madam, to believe me. Har .  Did ever anybody see such folly? He is becoming worse and worse. Cle .  Would you have me false to my inmost feelings? Har .  Again! Change your manners, if you please. Cle .  Very well, since you wish me to speak differently. Allow me,  Madam, to take for a moment my father's place; and forgive me if I  tell you that I never saw in the world anybody more charming than you  are; that I can understand no happiness to equal that of pleasing you,  and that to be your husband is a glory, a felicity, I should prefer to  the destinies of the greatest princes upon earth. Yes, Madam, to  possess you is, in my mind, to possess the best of all treasures; to  obtain you is all my ambition. There is nothing I would not do for so  precious a conquest, and the most powerful obstacles … Har .  Gently, gently, my son, if you please. Cle .  These are complimentary words which I speak to her in your name. Har .  Bless me! I have a tongue of my own to explain my feelings, and I  really don't care for such an advocate as you … Here, bring us some  chairs. Fro .  No; I think it is better for us to go at once to the fair, in  order to be back earlier, and have plenty of time for talking. Har . ( to Brindavoine ). Have the carriage ready at once. SCENE XII.——HARPAGON,  MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE. Har . ( to Marianne ).  I hope you will excuse me, my dear, but I  forgot to order some refreshments for you, before you went out. Cle .  I have thought of it, father, and have ordered to be brought in  here some baskets of China oranges, sweet citrons, and preserves,  which I sent for in your name. Har . ( aside, to Valère ). Valère! Val . ( aside, to Harpagon ). He has lost his senses! Cle .  You are afraid, father, that it will not be enough? I hope,  Madam, that you will have the kindness to excuse it. Mar .  It was by no means necessary. Cle .  Did you ever see, Madam, a more brilliant diamond than the one my  father has upon his finger? Mar .  It certainly sparkles very much. Cle .  ( taking the diamond off his father's finger ). You must see  it near. Mar .  It is a beautiful one; it possesses great lustre. Cle . ( steps before Marianne , who wants to restore it ).  No, Madam, it is in hands too beautiful; it is a present my father  gives you. Har . I? Cle .  Is it not true, father, that you wish her to keep it for your  sake? Har .  ( aside, to his son ). What? Cle .  ( to Marianne ).  A strange question indeed! He is making me  signs that I am to force you to accept it. Mar . I would not … Cle . ( to Marianne ).  I beg of you…. He would not take it back. Har .  ( aside ). I am bursting with rage! Mar .  It would be … Cle . ( still hindering Marianne from returning it ). No; I  tell you, you will offend him. Mar . Pray … Cle . By no means. Har .  ( aside ). Plague take … Cle .  He is perfectly shocked at your refusal. Har .  ( aside, to his son ). Ah! traitor! Cle .  ( to Marianne ).  You see he is in despair. Har .  ( aside, to his son, threatening him ). You villain! Cle .  Really, father, it is not my fault. I do all I can to persuade  her to accept it; but she is obstinate. Har .  ( in a rage, aside to his son ). Rascal! Cle .  You are the cause, Madam, of my father scolding me. Har .  ( aside, with the same looks ). Scoundrel! Cle .  ( to Marianne ).  You will make him ill; for goodness' sake,  hesitate no longer. Fro .  ( to Marianne ).  Why so much ceremony? Keep the ring, since  the gentleman wishes you to. Mar .  ( to Harpagon ).  I will keep it now, Sir, in order not to  make you angry, and I shall take another opportunity of returning it  to you. SCENE XIII.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE,  VALÈRE, FROSINE, BRINDAVOINE. Brind .  Sir, there is a gentleman here who wants to speak to you. Har .  Tell him that I am engaged, and that I cannot see him to-day. Brind .  He says he has some money for you. Har . ( to Marianne ).  Pray, excuse me; I will come back directly. SCENE XIV.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE,  ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, FROSINE, LA MERLUCHE. La Mer .  ( comes in running, and throws Harpagon down ).  Sir … Har . Oh! he has killed me. Cle .  What's the matter, father? Have you hurt yourself? Har .  The wretch must have been bribed by some of my debtors to break  my neck. Val .  ( to Harpagon ).  There is nothing serious. La Mer .  ( to Harpagon ).  I beg your pardon, Sir; I thought I had  better run fast to tell you…. Har . What? La Mer .  That your two horses have lost their shoes. Har .  Take them quickly to the smith. Cle .  In the meantime, father, I will do the honours of the house for  you, and take this lady into the garden, where lunch will be brought. SCENE XV.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE. Har .  Valère, look after all this; and take care, I beseech you, to  save as much of it as you can, so that we may send it back to the  tradesman again. Val . I will. Har .  ( alone ). Miscreant! do you mean to ruin me? ACT IV. SCENE I.——CLÉANTE, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, FROSINE. Cle .  Let us come in here; we shall be much better. There is no one  about us that we need be afraid of, and we can speak openly. Eli .  Yes, Madam, my brother has told me of the love he has for you. I  know what sorrow and anxiety such trials as these may cause, and I  assure you that I have the greatest sympathy for you. Mar .  I feel it a great comfort in my trouble to have the sympathy of a  person like you, and I entreat you, Madam, ever to retain for me a  friendship so capable of softening the cruelty of my fate. Fro .  You really are both very unfortunate not to have told me of all  this before. I might certainly have warded off the blow, and not have  carried things so far. Cle .  What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.  But you, fair Marianne, what have you resolved to do? What resolution  have you taken? Mar .  Alas! Is it in my power to take any resolution? And, dependent as  I am, can I do anything else except form wishes? Cle .  No other support for me in your heart? Nothing but mere wishes?  No pitying energy? No kindly relief? No active affection? Mar .  What am I to say to you? Put yourself in my place, and judge what  I can possibly do. Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely  to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what  is modest and seemly. Cle .  Alas! to what do you reduce me when you wish me to be guided  entirely by feelings of strict duty and of scrupulous propriety. Mar .  But what would you have me do? Even if I were, for you, to divest  myself of the many scruples which our sex imposes on us, I have too  much regard for my mother, who has brought me up with great  tenderness, for me to give her any cause of sorrow. Do all you can  with her. Strive to win her. I give you leave to say and do all you  wish; and if anything depends upon her knowing the true state of my  feelings, by all means tell her what they are; indeed I will do it  myself if necessary. Cle .  Frosine, dear Frosine, will you not help us? Fro .  Indeed, I should like to do so, as you know. I am not naturally  unkind. Heaven has not given me a heart of flint, and I feel but too  ready to help when I see young people loving each other in all  earnestness and honesty. What can we do in this case? Cle .  Try and think a little. Mar . Advise us. Eli .  Invent something to undo what you have done. Fro .  Rather a difficult piece of business.  ( To Marianne ) As far  as your mother is concerned, she is not altogether unreasonable and we  might succeed in making her give to the son the gift she reserved for  the father. ( To Cléante )  But the most disheartening part of it  all is that your father is your father. Cle . Yes, so it is. Fro .  I mean that he will bear malice if he sees that he is refused,  and he will be in no way disposed afterwards to give his consent to  your marriage. It would be well if the refusal could be made to come  from him, and you ought to try by some means or other to make him  dislike you, Marianne. Cle . You are quite right. Fro .  Yes, right enough, no doubt. That is what ought to be done; but  how in the world are we to set about it? Wait a moment. Suppose we had  a somewhat elderly woman with a little of the ability which I possess,  and able sufficiently well to represent a lady of rank, by means of a  retinue made up in haste, and of some whimsical title of a marchioness  or viscountess, whom we would suppose to come from Lower Brittany. I  should have enough power over your father to persuade him that she is  a rich woman, in possession, besides her houses, of a hundred thousand  crowns in ready money; that she is deeply in love with him, and that  she would marry him at any cost, were she even to give him all her  money by the marriage contract. I have no doubt he would listen to the  proposal. For certainly he loves you very much, my dear, but he loves  money still better. When once he has consented to your marriage, it  does not signify much how he finds out the true state of affairs about  our marchioness. Cle .  All that is very well made up. Fro .  Leave it to me; I just remember one of my friends who will do  beautifully. Cle .  Depend on my gratitude, Frosine, if you succeed. But, dear  Marianne, let us begin, I beg of you, by gaining over your mother; it  would be a great deal accomplished if this marriage were once broken  off. Make use, I beseech you, of all the power that her tenderness for  you gives you over her. Display without hesitation those eloquent  graces, those all-powerful charms, with which Heaven has endowed your  eyes and lips; forget not, I beseech you, those sweet persuasions,  those tender entreaties, those loving caresses to which, I feel,  nothing could be refused. Mar .  I will do all I can, and will forget nothing. SCENE II.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, FROSINE. Har . ( aside, and without being seen ).  Ah! ah! my son is kissing the  hand of his intended stepmother, and his intended stepmother does not  seem much averse to it! Can there be any mystery in all this? Eli .  Here comes my father. Har .  The carriage is quite ready, and you can start when you like. Cle .  Since you are not going, father, allow me to take care of them. Har .  No, stop here; they can easily take care of themselves, and I  want you. SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE. Har .  Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do  you think of this lady? Cle .  What I think of her? Har .  Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty  and intelligence? Cle . So, so. Har . But still? Cle .  To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her  manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward,  her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order.  Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must  have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any  other. Har .  You spoke to her just now, nevertheless…. Cle .  I paid her several compliments in your name, but it was to please  you. Har .  So then you don't care for her? Cle . Who? I? Not in the least. Har .  I am sorry for it, for that puts an end to a scheme which had  occurred to me. Since I have seen her here, I have been thinking of my  own age; and I feel that people would find fault with me for marrying  so young a girl. This consideration had made me determine to abandon  the project, and as I had demanded her in marriage, and had given her  my promise, I would have given her to you if it were not for the  dislike you have for her. Cle . To me? Har . To you. Cle . In marriage? Har . In marriage. Cle .  It is true she is not at all to my taste; but, to please you,  father, I will bring myself to marry her, if you please. Har .  If I please! I am more reasonable than you think. I don't wish to  compel you. Cle .  Excuse me! I will make an attempt to love her. Har .  No, no; a marriage cannot be happy where there is no love. Cle .  That, my father, will, perhaps, come by and by, and it is said  that love is often the fruit of marriage. Har .  No, it is not right to risk it on the side of the man, and there  are some troublesome things I don't care to run the chance of. If you  had felt any inclination for her, you should have married her instead  of me, but as it is, I will return to my first intention and marry her  myself. Cle .  Well, father, since things are so, I had better be frank with  you, and reveal our secret to you. The truth is that I have loved her  ever since I saw her one day on the promenade. I intended to ask you  today to let me marry her, and I was only deterred from it because you  spoke of marrying her, and because I feared to displease you. Har .  Have you ever paid her any visits? Cle . Yes, father. Har . Many? Cle .  Yes; considering how long we have been acquainted. Har . You were well received. Cle .  Very well, but without her knowing who I was; and that is why  Marianne was so surprised when she saw me today. Har .  Have you told her of your love, and of your intention of marrying  her? Cle .  Certainly, and I also spoke a little to the mother on the  subject. Har .  Did she kindly receive your proposal for her daughter? Cle . Yes, very kindly. Har .  And does the daughter return your love? Cle .  If I can believe appearances, she is certainly well disposed  towards me. Har .  ( aside ). Well! I am very glad to have found out this  secret; it is the very thing I wanted to know. ( To his son )  Now, look here, my son, I tell you what. You will have, if you please,  to get rid of your love for Marianne, to cease to pay your attentions  to a person I intend for myself, and to marry very soon the wife I  have chosen for you. Cle .  So, father, it is thus you deceive me! Very well, since things  are come to such a pass, I openly declare to you that I shall not give  up my love for Marianne. No! understand that henceforth there is  nothing from which I shall shrink in order to dispute her with you;  and if you have on your side the consent of the mother, perhaps I  shall have some other resources left to aid me. Har .  What, rascal! You dare to trespass on my grounds? Cle .  It is you who trespass on mine. I was the first. Har .  Am I not your father, and do you not owe me respect? Cle .  There are things in which children are not called upon to pay  deference to their fathers; and love is no respector of persons. Har .  My stick will make you know me better. Cle .  All your threatenings are nothing to me. Har . You will give up Marianne? Cle . Never! Har .  Bring me my stick. Quick, I say! my stick! SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, MASTER JACQUES. Jac .  Hold! hold! Gentlemen, what does this mean? What are you thinking  of? Cle .  I don't care a bit for it. Jac .  ( to Cléante ). Ah! Sir, gently. Har .  He dares to speak to me with such impudence as that! Jac .  ( to Harpagon ). Ah! Sir, I beg of you. Cle . I shall keep to it. Jac .  ( to Cléante ).  What! to your father? Har . Let me do it. Jac .  ( to Harpagon ).  What! to your son? To me it's different. Har .  I will make you judge between us, Master Jacques, so that you may  see that I have right on my side. Jac . Willingly.  ( To Cléante )  Go a little farther back. Har .  There is a young girl I love and want to marry, and the scoundrel  has the impudence to love her also, and wants to marry her in spite of  me. Jac . Oh! he is wrong. Har .  Is it not an abominable thing to see a son who does not shrink  from becoming the rival of his father? And is it not his bounden duty  to refrain from interfering with my love? Jac .  You are quite right; stop here, and let me go and speak to him. Cle .  ( to Master Jacques , who comes near him ). Very well;  if he wants to make you a judge between us, I have no objection. I  care little who it is, and I don't mind referring our quarrel to you. Jac . You do me great honour. Cle .  I am in love with a young girl who returns my affection, and who  receives kindly the offer of my heart; but my father takes it into his  head to disturb our love by asking her in marriage. Jac .  He certainly is wrong. Cle .  Is it not shameful for a man of his age to think of marrying? I  ask you if it is right for him to fall in love? and ought he not now  to leave that to younger men? Jac .  You are quite right; he is not serious; let me speak a word or  two to him. ( To Harpagon )  Really, your son is not so extravagant  as you think, and is amenable to reason. He says that he is conscious  of the respect he owes you, and that he only got angry in the heat of  the moment. He will willingly submit to all you wish if you will only  promise to treat him more kindly than you do, and will give him in  marriage a person to his taste. Har .  Ah! tell him, Master Jacques, that he will obtain everything from  me on those terms, and that, except Marianne, I leave him free to  choose for his wife whomsoever he pleases. Jac . Leave that to me.  ( To Cléante )  Really, your father is not  so unreasonable as you make him out to me; and he tells me that it is  your violence which irritated him. He only objects to your way of  doing things, and is quite ready to grant you all you want, provided  you will use gentle means and will give him the deference, respect,  and submission that a son owes to his father. Cle .  Ah! Master Jacques, you can assure him that if he grants me  Marianne, he will always find me the most submissive of men, and that  I shall never do anything contrary to his pleasure. Jac .  ( to Harpagon ).  It's all right; he consents to what you  say. Har . Nothing could be better. Jac .  ( to Cléante ).  It's all settled; he is satisfied with your  promises. Cle . Heaven be praised! Jac .  Gentlemen, you have nothing to do but to talk quietly over the  matter together; you are agreed now, and yet you were on the point of  quarrelling through want of understanding each other. Cle .  My poor Jacques, I shall be obliged to you all my life. Jac .  Don't mention it, Sir. Har .  You have given me great pleasure, Master Jacques, and deserve a  reward. ( Harpagon feels in his pocket , Jacques holds out his  hand, but Harpagon only pulls out his handkerchief, and  says ,) Go; I will remember it, I promise you. Jac . I thank you kindly, Sir. SCENE V.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE. Cle .  I beg your pardon, father, for having been angry. Har .  It is nothing. Cle .  I assure you that I feel very sorry about it. Har .  I am very happy to see you reasonable again. Cle .  How very kind of you so soon to forget my fault. Har .  One easily forgets the faults of children when they return to  their duty. Cle .  What! you are not angry with me for my extravagant behaviour? Har .  By your submission and respectful conduct you compel me to forget  my anger. Cle .  I assure you, father, I shall for ever keep in heart the  remembrance of all your kindness. Har .  And I promise you that, in future, you will obtain all you like  from me. Cle .  Oh, father! I ask nothing more; it is sufficient for me that you  give me Marianne. Har . What? Cle .  I say, father, that I am only too thankful already for what you  have done, and that when you give me Marianne, you give me everything. Har .  Who talks of giving you Marianne? Cle . You, father. Har . I? Cle . Yes. Har .  What! is it not you who promised to give her up? Cle . I! give her up? Har . Yes. Cle .  Certainly not. Har .  Did you not give up all pretensions to her? Cle .  On the contrary, I am more determined than ever to have her. Har .  What, scoundrel! again? Cle .  Nothing can make me change my mind. Har .  Let me get at you again, wretch! Cle . You can do as you please. Har .  I forbid you ever to come within my sight. Cle . As you like. Har . I abandon you. Cle . Abandon me. Har . I disown you. Cle . Disown me. Har . I disinherit you. Cle . As you will. Har .  I give you my curse. Cle .  I want none of your gifts. SCENE VI.——CLÉANTE, LA FLÈCHE. La Fl .  ( leaving the garden with a casket ). Ah! Sir, you are  just in the nick of time. Quick! follow me. Cle . What is the matter? La Fl .  Follow me, I say. We are saved. Cle . How? La Fl .  Here is all you want. Cle . What? La Fl .  I have watched for this all day. Cle . What is it? La Fl .  Your father's treasure that I have got hold of. Cle .  How did you manage it? La Fl .  I will tell you all about it. Let us be off. I can hear him  calling out. SCENE VII.——HARPAGON, from the garden, rushing in without his hat,  and crying — Thieves! thieves! assassins! murder! Justice, just heavens! I am  undone; I am murdered; they have cut my throat; they have stolen my  money! Who can it be? What has become of him? Where is he? Where is he  hiding himself? What shall I do to find him? Where shall I run? Where  shall I not run? Is he not here? Who is this? Stop! ( To himself,  taking hold of his own arm ) Give me back my money, wretch….  Ah…! it is myself…. My mind is wandering, and I know not where I  am, who I am, and what I am doing. Alas! my poor money! my poor money!  my dearest friend, they have bereaved me of thee; and since thou art  gone, I have lost my support, my consolation, and my joy. All is ended  for me, and I have nothing more to do in the world! Without thee it is  impossible for me to live. It is all over with me; I can bear it no  longer. I am dying; I am dead; I am buried. Is there nobody who will  call me from the dead, by restoring my dear money to me, or by telling  me who has taken it? Ah! what is it you say? It is no one. Whoever has  committed the deed must have watched carefully for his opportunity,  and must have chosen the very moment when I was talking with my  miscreant of a son. I must go. I will demand justice, and have the  whole of my house put to the torture—my maids and my valets, my son,  my daughter, and myself too. What a crowd of people are assembled  here! Everyone seems to be my thief. I see no one who does not rouse  suspicion in me. Ha! what are they speaking of there? Of him who stole  my money? What noise is that up yonder? Is it my thief who is there?  For pity's sake, if you know anything of my thief, I beseech you to  tell me. Is he hiding there among you? They all look at me and laugh.  We shall see that they all have a share in the robbery. Quick!  magistrates, police, provosts, judges, racks, gibbets, and  executioners. I will hang everybody, and if I do not find my money, I  will hang myself afterwards. ACT V. SCENE I.——HARPAGON, A POLICE OFFICER. Off .  Leave that to me. I know my business. Thank Heaven! this is not  the first time I have been employed in finding out thieves; and I wish  I had as many bags of a thousand francs as I have had people hanged. Har .  Every magistrate must take this affair in hand; and if my money  is not found, I shall call justice against justice itself. Off .  We must take all needful steps. You say there was in that  casket…? Har .  Ten thousand crowns in cash. Off .  Ten thousand crowns! Har .  Ten thousand crowns. Off .  A considerable theft. Har .  There is no punishment great enough for the enormity of the  crime; and if it remain unpunished, the most sacred things are no  longer secure. Off .  In what coins was that sum? Har .  In good louis d'or and pistoles of full weight. Off .  Whom do you suspect of this robbery? Har .  Everybody. I wish you to take into custody the whole town and  suburbs. Off .  You must not, if you trust me, frighten anybody, but must use  gentle means to collect evidence, in order afterwards to proceed with  more rigour for the recovery of the sum which has been taken from you. SCENE II.——HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES. Jac .  ( at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he  came in ). I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his  feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling. Har . What! Him who has robbed me? Jac .  I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent  me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy. Har .  This is no longer the question; and you have to speak of  something else to this gentleman. Off . ( to Jacques ). Don't get frightened. I am not a man to  cause any scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means. Jac . ( to Harpagon ). Is this gentleman coming to supper with  you? Off .  You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your  master. Jac .  Indeed, Sir, I will show you all I know, and will treat you in  the best manner I possibly can. Off .  That's not the question. Jac .  If I do not give as good fare as I should like, it is the fault  of your steward, who has clipped my wings with the scissors of his  economy. Har. Rascal! We have other matters to talk about than your supper; and  I want you to tell me what has become of the money which has been  stolen from me. Jac .  Some money has been stolen from you? Har .  Yes, you rascal! And I'll have you hanged if you don't give it me  back again. Off . ( to Harpagon ).  Pray, don't be hard upon him. I see by his  looks that he is an honest fellow, and that he will tell you all you  want to know without going to prison. Yes, my friend, if you confess,  no harm shall come to you, and you shall be well rewarded by your  master. Some money has been stolen from him, and it is not possible  that you know nothing about it. Jac . ( aside ).  The very thing I wanted in order to be revenged  of our steward. Ever since he came here, he has been the favourite,  and his advice is the only one listened to. Moreover, I have forgotten  neither the cudgelling of to-day nor … Har .  What are you muttering about there? Off . ( to Harpagon ).  Leave him alone. He is preparing himself to  satisfy you; I told you that he was an honest fellow. Jac .  Sir, since you want me to tell you what I know, I believe it is  your steward who has done this. Har . Valère? Jac . Yes. Har .  He who seemed so faithful to me! Jac .  Himself. I believe that it is he who has robbed you. Har .  And what makes you believe it? Jac .  What makes me believe it? Har . Yes. Jac .  I believe it … because I believe it. Off .  But you must tell us the proofs you have. Har .  Did you see him hanging about the place where I had put my money? Jac . Yes, indeed. Where was your money? Har . In the garden. Jac .  Exactly; I saw him loitering about in the garden; and in what was  your money? Har .  In a casket. Jac .  The very thing. I saw him with a casket. Har .  And this casket, what was it like? I shall soon see if it is  mine. Jac .  What it was like? Har . Yes. Jac .  It was like … like a casket. Off .  Of course. But describe it a little, to see if it is the same. Jac .  It was a large casket. Har .  The one taken from me is a small one. Jac .  Yes, small if you look at it in that way; but I call it large  because of what it contains. Har .  And what colour was it? Jac . What colour? Off . Yes. Jac .  Of a colour … of a certain colour…. Can't you help me to find  the word? Har . Ugh! Jac . Red; isn't it? Har . No, grey. Jac .  Ha! yes, reddish-grey! That's what I meant. Har .  There is no doubt about it, it's my casket for certain. Write  down his evidence, Sir! Heavens! whom can we trust after that? We must  never swear to anything, and I believe now that I might rob my own  self. Jac .  ( to Harpagon ).  There he is coming back, Sir; I beg of you  not to go and tell him that it was I who let it all out, Sir. SCENE III.——HARPAGON,  THE POLICE OFFICER, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Har .  Come, come near, and confess the most abominable action, the most  horrible crime, that was ever committed. Val .  What do you want, Sir? Har .  What, wretch! you do not blush for shame after such a crime? Val .  Of what crime do you speak? Har .  Of what crime I speak? Base villain, as if you did not know what  I mean! It is in vain for you to try to hide it; the thing is  discovered, and I have just heard all the particulars. How could you  thus abuse my kindness, introduce yourself on purpose into my house to  betray me, and to play upon me such an abominable trick? Val .  Sir, since everything is known to you, I will neither deny what I  have done nor will I try to palliate it. Jac .  ( aside ). Oh! oh! Have I guessed the truth? Val .  I intended to speak to you about it, and I was watching for a  favourable opportunity; but, as this is no longer possible, I beg of  you not to be angry, and to hear my motives. Har .  And what fine motives can you possibly give me, infamous thief? Val .  Ah! Sir, I do not deserve these names. I am guilty towards you,  it is true; but, after all, my fault is pardonable. Har .  How pardonable? A premeditated trick, and such an assassination  as this! Val .  I beseech you not to be so angry with me. When you have heard all  I have to say, you will see that the harm is not so great as you make  it out to be. Har .  The harm not so great as I make it out to be! What! my heart's  blood, scoundrel! Val .  Your blood, Sir, has not fallen into bad hands. My rank is high  enough not to disgrace it, and there is nothing in all this for which  reparation cannot be made. Har .  It is, indeed, my intention that you should restore what you have  taken from me. Val .  Your honour, Sir, shall be fully satisfied. Har .  Honour is not the question in all this. But tell me what made you  commit such a deed? Val .  Alas! do you ask it? Har .  Yes, I should rather think that I do. Val .  A god, Sir, who carries with him his excuses for all he makes  people do: Love. Har . Love? Val . Yes. Har .  Fine love that! fine love, indeed! the love of my gold! Val .  No, Sir, it is not your wealth that has tempted me, it is not  that which has dazzled me; and I swear never to pretend to any of your  possessions, provided you leave me what I have. Har .  In the name of all the devils, no, I shall not leave it to you.  But did anyone ever meet with such villainy! He wishes to keep what he  has robbed me of! Val . Do you call that a robbery? Har .  If I call that a robbery? A treasure like that! Val .  I readily acknowledge that it is a treasure, and the most  precious one you have. But it will not be losing it to leave it to me.  I ask you on my knees to leave in my possession this treasure so full  of charms; and if you do right, you will grant it to me. Har .  I will do nothing of the kind. What in the world are you driving  at? Val .  We have pledged our faith to each other, and have taken an oath  never to forsake one another. Har .  The oath is admirable, and the promise strange enough! Val .  Yes, we are engaged to each other for ever. Har .  I know pretty well how to disengage you, I assure you of that. Val .  Nothing but death can separate us. Har .  You must be devilishly bewitched by my money. Val .  I have told you already, Sir, that it is not self-interest which  has prompted me to what I have done. It was not that which prompted my  heart; a nobler motive inspired me. Har .  We shall hear presently that it is out of Christian charity that  he covets my money! But I will put a stop to all this, and justice,  impudent rascal, will soon give me satisfaction. Val .  You will do as you please, and I am ready to suffer all the  violence you care to inflict upon me, but I beg of you to believe, at  least, that if there is any harm done, I am the only one guilty, and  that your daughter has done nothing wrong in all this. Har .  I should think not! It would be strange, indeed, if my daughter  had a share in this crime. But I will have that treasure back again,  and you must confess to what place you have carried it off. 6 Val .  I have not carried it off, and it is still in your house. Har . ( aside ). O my beloved casket!  ( To Valère ) My  treasure has not left my house? Val . No, Sir. Har .  Well, then, tell me, have you taken any liberties with…? Val .  Ah! Sir, you wrong us both; the flame with which I burn is too  pure, too full of respect. Har .  ( aside ). He burns for my casket! Val .  I had rather die than show the least offensive thought: I found  too much modesty and too much purity for that. Har . ( aside ). My cash-box modest! Val .  All my desires were limited to the pleasures of sight, and  nothing criminal has profaned the passion those fair eyes have  inspired me with. Har . ( aside ).  The fair eyes of my cash-box! He speaks of it as  a lover does of his mistress. Val .  Dame Claude knows the whole truth, and she can bear witness to  it. Har .  Hallo! my servant is an accomplice in this affair? Val .  Yes, Sir, she was a witness to our engagement; and it was after  being sure of the innocence of my love that she helped me to persuade  your daughter to engage herself to me. Har . Ah!  ( Aside ) Has the fear of justice made him lose his  senses? ( To Valère )  What rubbish are you talking about my  daughter? Val .  I say, Sir, that I found it most difficult to make her modesty  consent to what my love asked of her. Har .  The modesty of whom? Val .  Of your daughter; and it was only yesterday that she could make  up her mind to sign our mutual promise of marriage. Har .  My daughter has signed a promise of marriage? Val .  Yes, Sir, and I have also signed. Har .  O heavens! another misfortune! Jac .  ( to the Officer ).  Write, Sir, write. Har . Aggravation of misery!  Excess of despair! ( To the Officer )  Sir, discharge your duty, and draw me up an indictment against him as  a thief and a suborner. Jac .  As a thief and a suborner. Val .  These are names which I do not deserve, and when you know who I  am … SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE,  VALÈRE, FROSINE, MASTER JACQUES, THE POLICE OFFICER. Har .  Ah! guilty daughter! unworthy of a father like me! is it thus  that you put into practice the lessons I have given you? You give your  love to an infamous thief, and engage yourself to him without my  consent! But you shall both be disappointed.  ( To Élise ) Four  strong walls will answer for your conduct in the future; ( to Valère )  and good gallows, impudent thief, shall do me justice for your  audacity. Val .  Your anger will be no judge in this affair, and I shall at least  have a hearing before I am condemned. Har .  I was wrong to say gallows; you shall be broken alive on the  wheel. Eli .  ( kneeling to her father ). Ah! my father, be more merciful,  I beseech you, and do not let your paternal authority drive matters to  extremes. Do not suffer yourself to be carried away by the first  outburst of your anger, but give yourself time to consider what you  do. Take the trouble of inquiring about him whose conduct has offended  you. He is not what you imagine, and you will think it less strange  that I should have given myself to him, when you know that without him  you would long ago have lost me for ever. Yes, father, it is he who  saved me from the great danger I ran in the waters, and to whom you  owe the life of that very daughter who … Har .  All this is nothing; and it would have been much better for me if  he had suffered you to be drowned rather than do what he has done. Eli .  My father, I beseech you, in the name of paternal love, grant  me … Har .  No, no. I will hear nothing, and justice must have its course. Jac . ( aside ).  You shall pay me for the blows you gave me. Fro .  What a perplexing state of affairs! SCENE V.——ANSELME, HARPAGON, ÉLISE,  MARIANNE, FROSINE, VALÈRE, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES. Ans .  What can have happened, Mr. Harpagon? You are quite upset. Har .  Ah, Mr. Anselme, you see in me the most unfortunate of men; and  you can never imagine what vexation and disorder is connected with the  contract you have come to sign! I am attacked in my property; I am  attacked in my honour; and you see there a scoundrel and a wretch who  has violated the most sacred rights, who has introduced himself into  my house as a servant in order to steal my money, and seduce my  daughter. Val .  Who ever thought of your money about which you rave? Har .  Yes; they have given each other a promise of marriage. This  insult concerns you, Mr. Anselme; and it is you who ought to be  plaintiff against him, and who at your own expense ought to prosecute  him to the utmost, in order to be revenged. Ans .  It is not my intention to force anybody to marry me, and to lay  claim to a heart which has already bestowed itself; but as far as your  interests are concerned, I am ready to espouse them as if they were my  own. Har .  This is the gentleman, an honest commissary, who has promised  that he will omit nothing of what concerns the duties of his office.  ( To the Officer , showing Valère ) Charge him, Sir, as he  ought to be, and make matters very criminal. Val .  I do not see what crime they can make of my passion for your  daughter, nor the punishment you think I ought to be condemned to for  our engagement; when it is known who I am … Har .  I don't care a pin for all those stories, and the world is full,  nowadays, of those pretenders to nobility, of those impostors, who  take advantage of their obscurity and deck themselves out insolently  with the first illustrious name that comes into their head. Val .  Know that I am too upright to adorn myself with a name which is  not mine, and that all Naples can bear testimony to my birth! Ans .  Softly! Take care of what you are about to say. You speak before  a man to whom all Naples is known, and who can soon see if your story  is true. Val . ( proudly putting on his hat ).  I am not the man to fear  anything; and if all Naples is known to you, you know who was Don  Thomas d'Alburci. Ans .  Certainly; I know who he is, and few people know him better than  I do. Har .  I care neither for Don Thomas nor Don Martin. ( Seeing two  candles burning, he blows one out .) Ans .  Have patience and let him speak; we shall soon know what he has  to say of him. Val .  That it is to him that I owe my birth. Ans . To him? Val . Yes. Ans .  Nonsense; you are laughing. Try and make out a more likely story,  and don't pretend to shelter yourself under such a piece of imposture. Val .  Consider your words better before you speak; it is no imposture,  and I say nothing here that I cannot prove. Ans .  What! You dare to call yourself the son of Don Thomas d'Alburci? Val .  Yes, I dare to do so; and I am ready to maintain the truth  against anyone, who ever he may be. Ans .  This audacity is marvellous. Learn to your confusion that it is  now at least sixteen years ago since the man of whom you speak died in  a shipwreck at sea with his wife and children, when he was trying to  save their lives from the cruel persecutions which accompanied the  troubles at Naples, and which caused the banishment of several noble  families. Val .  Yes; but learn to your confusion that his son, seven  years of age, was, with a servant, saved from the wreck by a Spanish  vessel, and that this son is he who now speaks to you. Learn that the  captain of that ship, touched with compassion at my misfortune, loved  me; that he had me brought up as his own son, and that the profession  of arms has been my occupation ever since I was fit for it; that  lately I heard that my father is not dead, as I thought he was; that,  passing this way to go and find him out, an accident, arranged by  heaven, brought to my sight the charming Élise; that the sight of her  made me a slave to her beauty, and that the violence of my love and  the harshness of her father made me take the resolution to come into  his house disguised as a servant, and to send some one else to look  after my parents. Ans .  But what other proofs have you besides your own words that all  this is not a fable based by you upon truth. Val .  What proofs? The captain of the Spanish vessel; a ruby seal which  belonged to my father; an agate bracelet which my mother put upon my  arm; and old Pedro, that servant who was saved with me from the wreck. Mar .  Alas! I can answer here for what you have said; that you do not  deceive us; and all you say clearly tells me that you are my brother. Val . You my sister! Mar .  Yes, my heart was touched as soon as you began to speak; and our  mother, who will be delighted at seeing you, often told me of the  misfortunes of our family. Heaven spared us also in that dreadful  wreck; but our life was spared at the cost of our liberty, for my  mother and myself were taken up by pirates from the wreck of our  vessel. After ten years of slavery a lucky event gave us back to  liberty, and we returned to Naples, where we found all our property  sold, and could hear no news of our father. We embarked for Genoa,  where my mother went to gather what remained of a family estate which  had been much disputed. Leaving her unjust relatives, she came here,  where she has lived but a weary life. Ans .  O heaven! how wonderful are thy doings, and how true it is that  it only belongs to thee to work miracles! Come to my arms, my  children, and share the joy of your happy father! Val .  You are our father? Mar .  It was for you that my mother wept? Ans .  Yes, my daughter; yes, my son; I am Don Thomas d'Alburci, whom  heaven saved from the waves, with all the money he had with him, and  who, after sixteen years, believing you all dead, was preparing, after  long journeys, to seek the consolations of a new family in marrying a  gentle and virtuous woman. The little security there was for my life  in Naples has made me abandon the idea of returning there, and having  found the means of selling what I had, I settled here under the name  of Anselme. I wished to forget the sorrows of a name associated with  so many and great troubles. Har . ( to Anselme ). He is your son? Ans . Yes. Har .  That being so, I make you responsible for the ten thousand crowns  that he has stolen from me. Ans .  He steal anything from you! Har . Yes. Val . Who said so? Har .  Master Jacques. Val .  ( to Master Jacques ). You say that? Jac .  You see that I am not saying anything. Har .  He certainly did. There is the officer who has received his  deposition. Val .  Can you really believe me capable of such a base action? Har .  Capable or not capable, I must find my money. SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, ANSELME, ÉLISE, MARIANNE,  CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, THE POLICE OFFICER,  MASTER JACQUES, LA FLÈCHE. Cle .  Do not grieve for your money, father, and accuse any one. I have  news of it, and I come here to tell you that if you consent to let me  marry Marianne, your money will be given back to you. Har . Where is it? Cle .  Do not trouble yourself about that. It is in a safe place, and I  answer for it; everything depends on your resolve. It is for you to  decide, and you have the choice either of losing Marianne or your  cash-box. Har .  Has nothing been taken out? Cle .  Nothing at all. Is it your intention to agree to this marriage,  and to join your consent to that of her mother, who leaves her at  liberty to do as she likes? Mar .  ( to Cléante ).  But you do not know that this consent is no  longer sufficient, and that heaven has given me back a brother  ( showing Valère ),  at the same time that it has given me back a  father ( showing Anselme );  and you have now to obtain me from him. Ans .  Heaven, my dear children, has not restored you to me that I might  oppose your wishes. Mr. Harpagon, you must be aware that the choice of  a young girl is more likely to fall upon the son than upon the father.  Come, now, do not force people to say to you what is unnecessary, and  consent, as I do, to this double marriage. Har .  In order for me to be well advised, I must see my casket. Cle .  You shall see it safe and sound. Har .  I have no money to give my children in marriage. Ans .  Never mind, I have some; do not let this trouble you. Har .  Do you take upon yourself to defray the expenses of these two  weddings? Ans .  Yes, I will take this responsibility upon myself. Are you  satisfied? Har .  Yes, provided you order me a new suit of clothes for the wedding. Ans .  Agreed! Let us go and enjoy the blessings this happy day brings  us. Off .  Stop, Sirs, stop; softly, if you please. Who is to pay me for my  writing? Har .  We have nothing to do with your writing. Off .  Indeed! and yet I do not pretend to have done it for nothing. Har .  ( showing Master Jacques ).  There is a fellow you can hang  in payment! Jac .  Alas! what is one to do? I receive a good cudgelling for telling  the truth, and now they would hang me for lying. Ans .  Mr. Harpagon, you must forgive him this piece of imposture. Har .  You will pay the officer then? Ans .  Let it be so. Let us go quickly, my children, to share our joy  with your mother! Har .  And I to see my dear casket THE END FOOTNOTES 1. An old comic pastoral. 2 . The real hero in Rabelais' 'Pantagruel.' 3 . Frosine professes a knowledge of palmistry. 4 . Old enemies.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™ Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of  computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It  exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations  from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the  assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will  remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future  generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread  public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND  DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state  visit www.gutenberg.org/donate . While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation  methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To  donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project  Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be  freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and  distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of  volunteer support. Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed  editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in  the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not  necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper  edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search  facility: www.gutenberg.org . This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</th>\n",

Title : The Miser Author : Molière Translator : Charles Heron Wall Release date : November 1, 2004 [eBook #6923] Most recently updated: May 13, 2023 Language : English Credits : E-text prepared by Delphine Lettau and the Project Gutenberg Online Distributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net) *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MISER *** THE MISER. (L'AVARE.) BY MOLIÈRE TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH PROSE. WITH A SHORT INTRODUCTION AND EXPLANATORY NOTES. BY CHARLES HERON WALL This play was acted for the first time on September 9, 1668. In it,  Molière has borrowed from Plautus, and has imitated several other  authors, but he far surpasses them in the treatment of his subject.  The picture of the miser, in whom love of money takes the place of all  natural affections, who not only withdraws from family intercourse,  but considers his children as natural enemies, is finely drawn, and  renders Molière's Miser altogether more dramatic and moral than those  of his predecessors. Molière acted the part of Harpagon. PERSONS REPRESENTED. Harpagon , father to Cléante , in love with Marianne . Cléante , Harpagon's son, lover to Marianne .

What, dear Élise! you grow sad after having given me such dear  tokens of your love; and I see you sigh in the midst of my joy! Can  you regret having made me happy? and do you repent of the engagement  which my love has forced from you? Eli .  No, Valère, I do not regret what I do for you; I feel carried on  by too delightful a power, and I do not even wish that things should  be otherwise than they are. Yet, to tell you the truth, I am very  anxious about the consequences; and I greatly fear that I love you  more than I should. Val .  What can you possibly fear from the affection you have shown me? Eli .  Everything; the anger of my father, the reproaches of my family,  the censure of the world, and, above all, Valère, a change in your  heart! I fear that cruel coldness with which your sex so often repays  the too warm proofs of an innocent love. Val .  Alas! do not wrong me thus; do not judge of me by others. Think  me capable of everything, Élise, except of falling short of what I owe  to you. I love you too much for that; and my love will be as lasting  as my life! Eli .  Ah! Valère, all men say the same thing; all men are alike in  their words; their actions only show the difference that exists  between them. Val .  Then why not wait for actions, if by them alone you can judge of  the truthfulness of my heart? Do not suffer your anxious fears to  mislead you, and to wrong me. Do not let an unjust suspicion destroy  the happiness which is to me dearer than life; but give me time to  show you by a thousand proofs the sincerity of my affection. Eli .  Alas! how easily do we allow ourselves to be persuaded by those  we love. I believe you, Valère; I feel sure that your heart is utterly  incapable of deceiving me, that your love is sincere, and that you  will ever remain faithful to me. I will no longer doubt that happiness  is near. If I grieve, it will only be over the difficulties of our  position, and the possible censures of the world. Val . But why even this fear? Eli .  Oh, Valère! if everybody knew you as I do, I should not have much  to fear. I find in you enough to justify all I do for you; my heart  knows all your merit, and feels, moreover, bound to you by deep  gratitude. How can I forget that horrible moment when we met for the  first time? Your generous courage in risking your own life to save  mine from the fury of the waves; your tender care afterwards; your  constant attentions and your ardent love, which neither time nor  difficulties can lessen! For me you neglect your parents and your  country; you give up your own position in life to be a servant of my  father! How can I resist the influence that all this has over me? Is  it not enough to justify in my eyes my engagement to you? Yet, who  knows if it will be enough to justify it in the eyes of others? and  how can I feel sure that my motives will be understood? Val .  You try in vain to find merit in what I have done; it is by my  love alone that I trust to deserve you. As for the scruples you feel,  your father himself justifies you but too much before the world; and  his avarice and the distant way in which he lives with his children  might authorise stranger things still. Forgive me, my dear Élise, for  speaking thus of your father before you; but you know that,  unfortunately, on this subject no good can be said of him. However, if  I can find my parents, as I fully hope I shall, they will soon be  favourable to us. I am expecting news of them with great impatience;  but if none comes I will go in search of them myself. Eli .  Oh no! Valère, do not leave me, I entreat you. Try rather to  ingratiate yourself in my father's favour. Val .  You know how much I wish it, and you can see how I set about it.  You know the skilful manoeuvres I have had to use in order to  introduce myself into his service; under what a mask of sympathy and  conformity of tastes I disguise my own feelings to please him; and  what a part I play to acquire his affection. I succeed wonderfully  well, and I feel that to obtain favour with men, there are no better  means than to pretend to be of their way of thinking, to fall in with  their maxims, to praise their defects, and to applaud all their  doings. One need not fear to overdo it, for however gross the  flattery, the most cunning are easily duped; there is nothing so  impertinent or ridiculous which they will not believe, provided it be  well seasoned with praise. Honesty suffers, I acknowledge; but when we  have need of men, we may be allowed without blame to adapt ourselves  to their mode of thought; and if we have no other hope of success but  through such stratagem, it is not after all the fault of those who  flatter, but the fault of those who wish to be flattered. Eli .  Why do you not try also to gain my brother's goodwill, in case  the servant should betray our secret? Val .  I am afraid I cannot humour them both. The temper of the father  is so different from that of the son that it would be difficult to be  the confidant of both at the same time. Rather try your brother  yourself; make use of the love that exists between you to enlist him  in our cause. I leave you, for I see him coming. Speak to him, sound  him, and see how far we can trust him. Eli .  I greatly fear I shall never have the courage to speak to him of  my secret. SCENE II.——CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, Cle .  I am very glad to find you alone, sister. I longed to speak to  you and to tell you a secret. Eli .  I am quite ready to hear you, brother. What is it you have to  tell me? Cle .  Many things, sister, summed up in one word—love. Eli . You love? Cle .  Yes, I love. But, before I say more, let me tell you that I know  I depend on my father, and that the name of son subjects me to his  will; that it would be wrong to engage ourselves without the consent  of the authors of our being; that heaven has made them the masters of  our affections, and that it is our duty not to dispose of ourselves  but in accordance to their wish; that their judgment is not biassed by  their being in love themselves; that they are, therefore, much more  likely not to be deceived by appearances, and to judge better what is  good for us; that we ought to trust their experience rather than the  passion which blinds us; and that the rashness of youth often carries  us to the very brink of dangerous abysses. I know all this, my sister,  and I tell it you to spare you the trouble of saying it to me, for my  love will not let me listen to anything, and I pray you to spare me  your remonstrances. Eli .  Have you engaged yourself, brother, to her you love? Cle .  No, but I have determined to do so; and I beseech you once more  not to bring forward any reason to dissuade me from it. Eli .  Am I such a very strange person, brother? Cle .  No, dear sister; but you do not love. You know not the sweet  power that love has upon our hearts; and I dread your wisdom. Eli .  Alas! my brother, let us not speak of my wisdom. There are very  few people in this world who do not lack wisdom, were it only once in  their lifetime; and if I opened my heart to you, perhaps you would  think me less wise than you are yourself. Cle .  Ah! would to heaven that your heart, like mine … Eli .  Let us speak of you first, and tell me whom it is you love. Cle .  A young girl who has lately come to live in our neighbourhood,  and who seems made to inspire love in all those who behold her.  Nature, my dear sister, has made nothing more lovely; and I felt  another man the moment I saw her. Her name is Marianne, and she lives  with a good, kind mother, who is almost always ill, and for whom the  dear girl shows the greatest affection. She waits upon her, pities and  comforts her with a tenderness that would touch you to the very soul.  Whatever she undertakes is done in the most charming way; and in all  her actions shine a wonderful grace, a most winning gentleness, an  adorable modesty, a … ah! my sister, how I wish you had but seen  her. Eli .  I see many things in what you tell me, dear brother; and it is  sufficient for me to know that you love her for me to understand what  she is. Cle .  I have discovered, without their knowing it, that they are not in  very good circumstances, and that, although they live with the  greatest care, they have barely enough to cover their expenses. Can  you imagine, my sister, what happiness it must be to improve the  condition of those we love; skilfully to bring about some relief to  the modest wants of a virtuous family? And think what grief it is for  me to find myself deprived of this great joy through the avarice of a  father, and for it to be impossible for me to give any proof of my  love to her who is all in all to me. Eli .  Yes, I understand, dear brother, what sorrow this must be to you. Cle .  It is greater, my sister, than you can believe. For is there  anything more cruel than this mean economy to which we are subjected?  this strange penury in which we are made to pine? What good will it do  us to have a fortune if it only comes to us when we are not able to  enjoy it; if now to provide for my daily maintenance I get into debt  on every side; if both you and I are reduced daily to beg the help of  tradespeople in order to have decent clothes to wear? In short, I  wanted to speak to you that you might help me to sound my father  concerning my present feelings; and if I find him opposed to them, I  am determined to go and live elsewhere with this most charming girl,  and to make the best of what Providence offers us. I am trying  everywhere to raise money for this purpose; and if your circumstances,  dear sister, are like mine, and our father opposes us, let us both  leave him, and free ourselves from the tyranny in which his hateful  avarice has for so long held us. Eli .  It is but too true that every day he gives us more and more  reason to regret the death of our mother, and that … Cle .  I hear his voice. Let us go a little farther and finish our talk.  We will afterwards join our forces to make a common attack on his hard  and unkind heart. SCENE III.——HARPAGON, LA FLÈCHE. Har .  Get out of here, this moment; and let me have no more of your  prating. Now then, be gone out of my house, you sworn pickpocket, you  veritable gallows' bird. La Fl . ( aside ).  I never saw anything more wicked than this  cursed old man; and I truly believe, if I may be allowed to say so,  that he is possessed with a devil. Har .  What are you muttering there between your teeth? La Fl . Why do you send me away? Har .  You dare to ask me my reasons, you scoundrel? Out with you, this  moment, before I give you a good thrashing. La Fl .  What have I done to you? Har .  Done this, that I wish you to be off. La Fl .  My master, your son, gave me orders to wait for him. Har .  Go and wait for him in the street, then; out with you; don't stay  in my house, straight and stiff as a sentry, to observe what is going  on, and to make your profit of everything. I won't always have before  me a spy on all my affairs; a treacherous scamp, whose cursed eyes  watch all my actions, covet all I possess, and ferret about in every  corner to see if there is anything to steal. La Fl .  How the deuce could one steal anything from you? Are you a man  likely to be robbed when you put every possible thing under lock and  key, and mount guard day and night? Har .  I will lock up whatever I think fit, and mount guard when and  where I please. Did you ever see such spies as are set upon me to take  note of everything I do? ( Aside ) I tremble for fear he should  suspect something of my money. ( Aloud ) Now, aren't you a fellow  to give rise to stories about my having money hid in my house? La Fl .  You have some money hid in your house? Har .  No, scoundrel! I do not say that. ( Aside ) I am furious!  ( Aloud ) I only ask if out of mischief you do not spread abroad  the report that I have some? La Fl .  Oh! What does it matter whether you have money, or whether you  have not, since it is all the same to us? Har .  ( raising his hand to give La Flèche a blow ). Oh! oh! You  want to argue, do you? I will give you, and quickly too, some few of  these arguments about your ears. Get out of the house, I tell you once  more. La Fl .  Very well; very well. I am going. Har .  No, wait; are you carrying anything away with you? La Fl .  What can I possibly carry away? Har .  Come here, and let me see. Show me your hands. La Fl . There they are. Har . The others. La Fl . The others? Har . Yes. La Fl . There they are. Har .  ( pointing to La Flèche's breeches ).  Have you anything hid  in here? La Fl . Look for yourself. Har .  ( feeling the knees of the breeches ). These wide knee-breeches  are convenient receptacles of stolen goods; and I wish a pair  of them had been hanged. La Fl .  ( aside ). Ah! how richly such a man deserves what he  fears, and what joy it would be to me to steal some of his … Har . Eh? La Fl . What? Har . What is it you talk of stealing? La Fl .  I say that you feel about everywhere to see if I have been  stealing anything. Har .  And I mean to do so too. ( He feels in La Flèche's pockets ). La Fl .  Plague take all misers and all miserly ways! Har . Eh? What do you say? La Fl . What do I say? Har .  Yes. What is it you say about misers and miserly ways. La Fl .  I say plague take all misers and all miserly ways. Har . Of whom do you speak? La Fl . Of misers. Har . And who are they, these misers? La Fl . Villains and stingy wretches! Har . But what do you mean by that? La Fl .  Why do you trouble yourself so much about what I say? Har .  I trouble myself because I think it right to do so. La Fl .  Do you think I am speaking about you? Har .  I think what I think; but I insist upon your telling me to whom  you speak when you say that. La Fl .  To whom I speak? I am speaking to the inside of my hat. Har .  And I will, perhaps, speak to the outside of your head. La Fl .  Would you prevent me from cursing misers? Har .  No; but I will prevent you from prating and from being insolent.  Hold your tongue, will you? La Fl .  I name nobody. Har .  Another word, and I'll thrash you. La Fl .  He whom the cap fits, let him wear it. Har .  Will you be silent? La Fl .  Yes; much against my will. Har . Ah! ah! La Fl .  ( showing Harpagon one of his doublet pockets ).  Just look, here is one more pocket. Are you satisfied? Har .  Come, give it up to me without all that fuss. La Fl . Give you what? Har . What you have stolen from me. La Fl .  I have stolen nothing at all from you. Har . Are you telling the truth? La Fl . Yes. Har .  Good-bye, then, and now you may go to the devil. La Fl .  ( aside ). That's a nice way of dismissing anyone. Har .  I leave it to your conscience, remember! SCENE IV.——HARPAGON ( alone .) This rascally valet is a constant vexation to me; and I hate the very  sight of the good-for-nothing cripple. Really, it is no small anxiety  to keep by one a large sum of money; and happy is the man who has all  his cash well invested, and who needs not keep by him more than he  wants for his daily expenses. I am not a little puzzled to find in the  whole of this house a safe hiding-place. Don't speak to me of your  strong boxes, I will never trust to them. Why, they are just the very  things thieves set upon! SCENE V.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE and CLÉANTE are seen talking together at  the back of the stage . Har .  ( thinking himself alone .) Meanwhile, I hardly know whether  I did right to bury in my garden the ten thousand crowns which were  paid to me yesterday. Ten thousand crowns in gold is a sum  sufficiently … ( Aside, on perceiving Élise and Cléante whispering together ) Good heavens! I have betrayed myself; my  warmth has carried me away. I believe I spoke aloud while reasoning  with myself. ( To Cléante and Élise ) What do you want? Cle . Nothing, father. Har . Have you been here long? Eli . We have only just come. Har . Did you hear…? Cle . What, father? Har . There…! Cle . What? Har . What I was just now saying. Cle . No. Har . You did. I know you did. Eli .  I beg your pardon, father, but we did not. Har .  I see well enough that you overheard a few words. The fact is, I  was only talking to myself about the trouble one has nowadays to raise  any money; and I was saying that he is a fortunate man who has ten  thousand crowns in his house. Cle .  We were afraid of coming near you, for fear of intruding. Har .  I am very glad to tell you this, so that you may not misinterpret  things, and imagine that I said that it was I who have ten thousand  crowns. Cle .  We do not wish to interfere in your affairs. Har .  Would that I had them, these ten thousand crowns! Cle .  I should not think that … Har .  What a capital affair it would be for me. Cle . There are things … Har . I greatly need them. Cle . I fancy that … Har .  It would suit me exceedingly well. Eli . You are … Har .  And I should not have to complain, as I do now, that the times  are bad. Cle .  Hear me, father, you have no reason to complain; and everyone  knows that you are well enough off. Har .  How? I am well enough off! Those who say it are liars. Nothing  can be more false; and they are scoundrels who spread such reports. Eli . Don't be angry. Har .  It is strange that my own children betray me and become my  enemies. Cle .  Is it being your enemy to say that you have wealth? Har .  Yes, it is. Such talk and your extravagant expenses will be the  cause that some day thieves will come and cut my throat, in the belief  that I am made of gold. Cle .  What extravagant expenses do I indulge in? Har .  What! Is there anything more scandalous than this sumptuous  attire with which you jaunt it about the town? I was remonstrating  with your sister yesterday, but you are still worse. It cries  vengeance to heaven; and were we to calculate all you are wearing,  from head to foot, we should find enough for a good annuity. I have  told you a hundred times, my son, that your manners displease me  exceedingly; you affect the marquis terribly, and for you to be always  dressed as you are, you must certainly rob me. Cle .  Rob you? And how? Har .  How should I know? Where else could you find money enough to  clothe yourself as you do? Cle .  I, father? I play; and as I am very lucky, I spend in clothes all  the money I win. Har .  It is very wrong. If you are lucky at play, you should profit by  it, and place the money you win at decent interest, so that you may  find it again some day. I should like to know, for instance, without  mentioning the rest, what need there is for all these ribbons with  which you are decked from head to foot, and if half a dozen tags are  not sufficient to fasten your breeches. What necessity is there for  anyone to spend money upon wigs, when we have hair of our own growth,  which costs nothing. I will lay a wager that, in wigs and ribbons  alone, there are certainly twenty pistoles spent, and twenty pistoles  brings in at least eighteen livres six sous eight deniers per annum,  at only eight per cent interest. Cle . You are quite right. Har .  Enough on this subject; let us talk of something else. ( Aside,  noticing Cléante and Élise , who make signs to one another )  I believe they are making signs to one another to pick my pocket.  ( Aloud ) What do you mean by those signs? Eli .  We are hesitating as to who shall speak first, for we both have  something to tell you. Har .  And I also have something to tell you both. Cle .  We wanted to speak to you about marriage, father. Har .  The very thing I wish to speak to you about. Eli . Ah! my father! Har .  What is the meaning of that exclamation? Is it the word,  daughter, or the thing itself that frightens you? Cle .  Marriage may frighten us both according to the way you take it;  and our feelings may perhaps not coincide with your choice. Har .  A little patience, if you please. You need not be alarmed. I know  what is good for you both, and you will have no reason to complain of  anything I intend to do. To begin at the beginning. ( To Cléante )  Do you know, tell me, a young person, called Marianne, who  lives not far from here? Cle . Yes, father. Har . And you? Eli .  I have heard her spoken of. Har .  Well, my son, and how do you like the girl? Cle .  She is very charming. Har .  Her face? Cle . Modest and intelligent. Har . Her air and manner? Cle . Perfect, undoubtedly. Har .  Do you not think that such a girl well deserves to be thought of? Cle . Yes, father. Har .  She would form a very desirable match? Cle . Very desirable. Har .  That there is every likelihood of her making a thrifty and  careful wife. Cle . Certainly. Har .  And that a husband might live very happily with her? Cle .  I have not the least doubt about it. Har .  There is one little difficulty; I am afraid she has not the  fortune we might reasonably expect. Cle .  Oh, my father, riches are of little importance when one is sure  of marrying a virtuous woman. Har .  I beg your pardon. Only there is this to be said: that if we do  not find as much money as we could wish, we may make it up in  something else. Cle .  That follows as a matter of course. Har .  Well, I must say that I am very much pleased to find that you  entirely agree with me, for her modest manner and her gentleness have  won my heart; and I have made up my mind to marry her, provided I find  she has some dowry. Cle . Eh! Har . What now? Cle .  You are resolved, you say…? Har .  To marry Marianne. Cle . Who? you? you? Har .  Yes, I, I, I. What does all this mean? Cle .  I feel a sudden dizziness, and I must withdraw for a little  while. Har .  It will be nothing. Go quickly into the kitchen and drink a large  glass of cold water, it will soon set you all right again. SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE. Har .  There goes one of your effeminate fops, with no more stamina than  a chicken. That is what I have resolved for myself, my daughter. As to  your brother, I have thought for him of a certain widow, of whom I  heard this morning; and you I shall give to Mr. Anselme. Eli . To Mr. Anselme? Har .  Yes, a staid and prudent man, who is not above fifty, and of  whose riches everybody speaks. Eli . ( curtseying ).  I have no wish to marry, father, if you  please. Har . ( imitating Élise ).  And I, my little girl, my darling, I  wish you to marry, if you please. Eli .  ( curtseying again ). I beg your pardon, my father. Har .  ( again imitating Élise ).  I beg your pardon, my daughter. Eli .  I am the very humble servant of Mr. Anselme, but ( curtseying  again ), with your leave, I shall not marry him. Har .  I am your very humble servant, but ( again imitating Élise )  you will marry him this very evening. Eli . This evening? Har . This evening. Eli . ( curtseying again ).  It cannot be done, father. Har . ( imitating Élise ). It will be done, daughter. Eli . No. Har . Yes. Eli . No, I tell you. Har . Yes, I tell you. Eli .  You will never force me to do such a thing Har . I will force you to it. Eli .  I had rather kill myself than marry such a man. Har .  You will not kill yourself, and you will marry him. But did you  ever see such impudence? Did ever any one hear a daughter speak in  such a fashion to her father? Eli .  But did ever anyone see a father marry his daughter after such a  fashion? Har .  It is a match against which nothing can be said, and I am  perfectly sure that everybody will approve of my choice. Eli .  And I know that it will be approved of by no reasonable person. Har . ( seeing Valère ).  There is Valère coming. Shall we make him  judge in this affair? Eli . Willingly. Har .  You will abide by what he says? Eli .  Yes, whatever he thinks right, I will do. Har . Agreed. SCENE VII.——VALÈRE, HARPAGON, ÉLISE. Har .  Valère, we have chosen you to decide who is in the right, my  daughter or I. Val .  It is certainly you, Sir. Har .  But have you any idea of what we are talking about? Val .  No; but you could not be in the wrong; you are reason itself. Har .  I want to give her to-night, for a husband, a man as rich as he  is good; and the hussy tells me to my face that she scorns to take  him. What do you say to that? Val . What I say to it? Har . Yes? Val . Eh! eh! Har . What? Val .  I say that I am, upon the whole, of your opinion, and that you  cannot but be right; yet, perhaps, she is not altogether wrong;  and … Har .  How so? Mr. Anselme is an excellent match; he is a nobleman, and  a gentleman too; of simple habits, and extremely well off. He has no  children left from his first marriage. Could she meet with anything  more suitable? Val .  It is true. But she might say that you are going rather fast, and  that she ought to have at least a little time to consider whether her  inclination could reconcile itself to … Har .  It is an opportunity I must not allow to slip through my fingers.  I find an advantage here which I should not find elsewhere, and he  agrees to take her without dowry. Val . Without dowry? Har . Yes. Val .  Ah! I have nothing more to say. A more convincing reason could  not be found; and she must yield to that. Har .  It is a considerable saving to me. Val .  Undoubtedly; this admits of no contradiction. It is true that  your daughter might represent to you that marriage is a more serious  affair than people are apt to believe; that the happiness or misery of  a whole life depends on it, and that an engagement which is to last  till death ought not to be entered into without great consideration. Har . Without dowry! Val .  That must of course decide everything. There are certainly people  who might tell you that on such occasions the wishes of a daughter are  no doubt to be considered, and that this great disparity of age, of  disposition, and of feelings might be the cause of many an unpleasant  thing in a married life. Har . Without dowry! Val .  Ah! it must be granted that there is no reply to that; who in the  world could think otherwise? I do not mean to say but that there are  many fathers who would set a much higher value on the happiness of  their daughter than on the money they may have to give for their  marriage; who would not like to sacrifice them to their own interests,  and who would, above all things, try to see in a marriage that sweet  conformity of tastes which is a sure pledge of honour, tranquillity  and joy; and that … Har . Without dowry! Val .  That is true; nothing more can be said.  Without dowry. How can  anyone resist such arguments? Har .  ( aside, looking towards the garden ). Ah! I fancy I hear a  dog barking. Is anyone after my money.  ( To Valère ) Stop here,  I'll come back directly. SCENE VIII.——ÉLISE, VALÈRE. Eli .  Surely, Valère, you are not in earnest when you speak to him in  that manner? Val .  I do it that I may not vex him, and the better to secure my ends.  To resist him boldly would simply spoil everything. There are certain  people who are only to be managed by indirect means, temperaments  averse from all resistance, restive natures whom truth causes to rear,  who always kick when we would lead them on the right road of reason,  and who can only be led by a way opposed to that by which you wish  them to go. Pretend to comply with his wishes; you are much more  likely to succeed in the end, and … Eli .  But this marriage, Valère? Val .  We will find some pretext for breaking it off. Eli .  But what pretext can we find if it is to be concluded to-night? Val .  You must ask to have it delayed, and must feign some illness or  other. Eli .  But he will soon discover the truth if they call in the doctor. Val .  Not a bit of it. Do you imagine that a doctor understands what he  is about? Nonsense! Don't be afraid. Believe me, you may complain of  any disease you please, the doctor will be at no loss to explain to  you from what it proceeds. SCENE IX——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, VALÈRE. Har .  ( alone, at the farther end of the stage ). It is nothing,  thank heaven! Val .  ( not seeing Harpagon ).  In short, flight is the last  resource we have left us to avoid all this; and if your love, dear  Élise, is as strong as … ( Seeing Harpagon ) Yes, a daughter is  bound to obey her father. She has no right to inquire what a husband  offered to her is like, and when the most important question, \"without  dowry,\" presents itself, she should accept anybody that is given her. Har . Good; that was beautifully said! Val .  I beg your pardon, Sir, if I carry it a little too far, and take  upon myself to speak to her as I do. Har .  Why, I am delighted, and I wish you to have her entirely under  your control. ( To Élise )  Yes, you may run away as much as you  like. I give him all the authority over you that heaven has given me,  and I will have you do all that he tells you. Val .  After that, resist all my expostulations, if you can. SCENE X.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE. Val .  I will follow her, Sir, if you will allow me, and will continue  the lecture I was giving her. Har .  Yes, do so; you will oblige me greatly. Val .  She ought to be kept in with a tight hand. Har .  Quite true, you must … Val .  Do not be afraid; I believe I shall end by convincing her. Har .  Do so, do so. I am going to take a short stroll in the town, and  I will come back again presently. Val .  ( going towards the door through which Élise left, and  speaking as if it were to her ). Yes, money is more precious than  anything else in the world, and you should thank heaven that you have  so worthy a man for a father. He knows what life is. When a man offers  to marry a girl without a dowry, we ought to look no farther.  Everything is comprised in that, and \"without dowry\" compensates for  want of beauty, youth, birth, honour, wisdom, and probity. Har .  Ah! the honest fellow! he speaks like an oracle. Happy is he who  can secure such a servant! ACT II. SCENE I.——CLÉANTE, LA FLÈCHE. Cle .  How now, you rascal! where have you been hiding? Did I not give  you orders to…? La Fl .  Yes, Sir, and I came here resolved to wait for you without  stirring, but your father, that most ungracious of men, drove me into  the street in spite of myself, and I well nigh got a good drubbing  into the bargain. Cle .  How is our affair progressing? Things are worse than ever for us,  and since I left you, I have discovered that my own father is my  rival. La Fl . Your father in love? Cle .  It seems so; and I found it very difficult to hide from him what  I felt at such a discovery. La Fl .  He meddling with love! What the deuce is he thinking of? Does  he mean to set everybody at defiance? And is love made for people of  his build? Cle .  It is to punish me for my sins that this passion has entered his  head. La Fl .  But why do you hide your love from him? Cle .  That he may not suspect anything, and to make it more easy for me  to fall back, if need be, upon some device to prevent this marriage.  What answer did you receive? La Fl .  Indeed, Sir, those who borrow are much to be pitied, and we  must put up with strange things when, like you, we are forced to pass  through the hands of the usurers. Cle .  Then the affair won't come off? La Fl .  Excuse me; Mr. Simon, the broker who was recommended to us, is  a very active and zealous fellow, and says he has left no stone  unturned to help you. He assures me that your looks alone have won his  heart. Cle .  Shall I have the fifteen thousand francs which I want? La Fl .  Yes, but under certain trifling conditions, which you must  accept if you wish the bargain to be concluded. Cle .  Did you speak to the man who is to lend the money? La Fl .  Oh! dear no. Things are not done in that way. He is still more  anxious than you to remain unknown. These things are greater mysteries  than you think. His name is not by any means to be divulged, and he is  to be introduced to you to-day at a house provided by him, so that he  may hear from yourself all about your position and your family; and I  have not the least doubt that the mere name of your father will be  sufficient to accomplish what you wish. Cle .  Particularly as my mother is dead, and they cannot deprive me of  what I inherit from her. La Fl .  Well, here are some of the conditions which he has himself  dictated to our go-between for you to take cognisance of, before  anything is begun. \"Supposing that the lender is satisfied with all his securities, and  that the borrower is of age and of a family whose property is ample,  solid, secure, and free from all incumbrances, there shall be drawn up  a good and correct bond before as honest a notary as it is possible to  find, and who for this purpose shall be chosen by the lender, because  he is the more concerned of the two that the bond should be rightly  executed.\" Cle . There is nothing to say against that. LA FA. \"The lender, not to burden his conscience with the least  scruple, does not wish to lend his money at more than five and a half  per cent.\" Cle .  Five and a half per cent? By Jove, that's honest! We have nothing  to complain of. La Fl . That's true. \"But as the said lender has not in hand the sum required, and as, in  order to oblige the borrower, he is himself obliged to borrow from  another at the rate of twenty per cent., it is but right that the said  first borrower shall pay this interest, without detriment to the rest;  since it is only to oblige him that the said lender is himself forced  to borrow.\" Cle .  The deuce! What a Jew! what a Turk we have here! That is more  than twenty-five per cent. La Fl .  That's true; and it is the remark I made. It is for you to  consider the matter before you act. Cle .  How can I consider? I want the money, and I must therefore accept  everything. La Fl .  That is exactly what I answered. Cle . Is there anything else? La Fl . Only a small item. \"Of the fifteen thousand francs which are demanded, the lender will  only be able to count down twelve thousand in hard cash; instead of  the remaining three thousand, the borrower will have to take the  chattels, clothing, and jewels, contained in the following catalogue,  and which the said lender has put in all good faith at the lowest  possible figure.\" Cle .   What is the meaning of all that? La Fl .  I'll go through the catalogue:— \"Firstly:—A fourpost bedstead, with hangings of Hungary lace very  elegantly trimmed with olive-coloured cloth, and six chairs and a  counterpane to match; the whole in very good condition, and lined with  soft red and blue shot-silk. Item:—the tester of good pale pink  Aumale serge, with the small and the large fringes of silk.\" Cle . What does he want me to do with all this? La Fl . Wait. \"Item:—Tapestry hangings representing the loves of Gombaud and  Macée. 1 Item:—A large walnut table with  twelve columns or turned legs, which draws out at both ends, and is  provided beneath with six stools.\" Cle .  Hang it all! What am I to do with all this? La Fl .  Have patience. \"Item:—Three large matchlocks inlaid with mother-of-pearl, with rests  to correspond. Item:—A brick furnace with two retorts and three  receivers, very useful to those who have any taste for distilling.\" Cle . You will drive me crazy. La Fl . Gently! \"Item:—A Bologna lute with all its strings, or nearly all. Item:—A  pigeon-hole table and a draught-board, and a game of mother goose,  restored from the Greeks, most useful to pass the time when one has  nothing to do. Item:—A lizard's skin, three feet and a half in  length, stuffed with hay, a pleasing curiosity to hang on the ceiling  of a room. The whole of the above-mentioned articles are really worth  more than four thousand five hundred francs, and are reduced to the  value of a thousand crowns through the considerateness of the lender.\" Cle .  Let the plague choke him with his considerateness, the wretch,  the cut-throat that he is! Did ever anyone hear of such usury? Is he  not satisfied with the outrageous interest he asks that he must force  me to take, instead of the three thousand francs, all the old rubbish  which he picks up. I shan't get two hundred crowns for all that, and  yet I must bring myself to yield to all his wishes; for he is in a  position to force me to accept everything, and he has me, the villain,  with a knife at my throat. La Fl .  I see you, Sir, if you'll forgive my saying so, on the high-road  followed by Panurge 2 to  ruin himself—taking money in advance, buying dear, selling cheap,  and cutting your corn while it is still grass. Cle .  What would you have me do? It is to this that young men are  reduced by the accursed avarice of their fathers; and people are  astonished after that, that sons long for their death. La Fl .  No one can deny that yours would excite against his meanness  the most quiet of men. I have not, thank God, any inclination gallows-  ward, and among my colleagues whom I see dabbling in various doubtful  affairs, I know well enough how to keep myself out of hot water, and  how to keep clear of all those things which savour ever so little of  the ladder; but to tell you the truth, he almost gives me, by his ways  of going on, the desire of robbing him, and I should think that in  doing so I was doing a meritorious action. Cle .  Give me that memorandum that I may have another look at it. SCENE II.——HARPAGON, MR. SIMON  (CLÉANTE and LA FLÈCHE at the  back of the stage ). Sim .  Yes, Sir; it is a young man who is greatly in want of money; his  affairs force him to find some at any cost, and he will submit to all  your conditions. Har .  But are you sure, Mr. Simon, that there is no risk to run in this  case? and do you know the name, the property, and the family of him  for whom you speak? Sim .  No; I cannot tell you anything for certain, as it was by mere  chance that I was made acquainted with him; but he will tell you  everything himself, and his servant has assured me that you will be  quite satisfied when you know who he is. All I can tell you is that  his family is said to be very wealthy, that he has already lost his  mother, and that he will pledge you his word, if you insist upon it,  that his father will die before eight months are passed. Har .  That is something. Charity, Mr. Simon, demands of us to gratify  people whenever we have it in our power. Sim . Evidently. La Fl . ( aside to Cléante , on recognising Mr. Simon ).  What does this mean? Mr. Simon talking with your father! Cle . ( aside to La Flèche ).  Has he been told who I am, and would  you be capable of betraying me? Sim . ( to Cléante and La Flèche ). Ah! you are in good  time! But who told you to come here? ( To Harpagon ) It was  certainly not I who told them your name and address; but I am of  opinion that there is no great harm done; they are people who can be  trusted, and you can come to some understanding together. Har . What! Sim . ( showing Cléante ). This is the gentleman who wants to  borrow the fifteen thousand francs of which I have spoken to you. Har .  What! miscreant! is it you who abandon yourself to such excesses? Cle .  What! father! is it you who stoop to such shameful deeds? ( M. Simon runs away, and La Flèche hides himself .) SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE. Har .  It is you who are ruining yourself by loans so greatly to be  condemned! Cle .  So it is you who seek to enrich yourself by such criminal usury! Har .  And you dare, after that, to show yourself before me? Cle .  And you dare, after that, to show yourself to the world? Har .  Are you not ashamed, tell me, to descend to these wild excesses,  to rush headlong into frightful expenses, and disgracefully to  dissipate the wealth which your parents have amassed with so much  toil. Cle .  Are you not ashamed of dishonouring your station by such  dealings, of sacrificing honour and reputation to the insatiable  desire of heaping crown upon crown, and of outdoing the most infamous  devices that have ever been invented by the most notorious usurers? Har .  Get out of my sight, you reprobate; get out of my sight! Cle .  Who is the more criminal in your opinion: he who buys the money  of which he stands in need, or he who obtains, by unfair means, money  for which he has no use? Har .  Begone, I say, and do not provoke me to anger. ( Alone )  After all, I am not very much vexed at this adventure; it will be a  lesson to me to keep a better watch over all his doings. SCENE IV.——FROSINE, HARPAGON. Fro . Sir. Har .  Wait a moment, I will come back and speak to you. ( Aside )  I had better go and see a little after my money. SCENE V.——LA FLÈCHE, FROSINE. La Fl . ( without seeing Frosine ). The adventure is most comical.  Hidden somewhere he must have a large store of goods of all kinds, for  the list did not contain one single article which either of us  recognised. Fro .  Hallo! is it you, my poor La Flèche? How is it we meet here? La Fl .  Ah! ah! it is you, Frosine; and what have you come to do here? Fro .  What have I come to do? Why! what I do everywhere else, busy  myself about other people's affairs, make myself useful to the  community in general, and profit as much as I possibly can by the  small talent I possess. Must we not live by our wits in this world?  and what other resources have people like me but intrigue and cunning? La Fl .  Have you, then, any business with the master of this house? Fro .  Yes. I am transacting for him a certain small matter for which he  is pretty sure to give me a reward. La Fl .  He give you a reward! Ah! ah! Upon my word, you will be 'cute  if you ever get one, and I warn you that ready money is very scarce  hereabouts. Fro .  That may be, but there are certain services which wonderfully  touch our feelings. La Fl .  Your humble servant; but as yet you don't know Harpagon.  Harpagon is the human being of all human beings the least humane, the  mortal of all mortals the hardest and closest. There is no service  great enough to induce him to open his purse. If, indeed, you want  praise, esteem, kindness, and friendship, you are welcome to any  amount; but money, that's a different affair. There is nothing more  dry, more barren, than his favour and his good grace, and  \" give \" is a word for which he has such a strong dislike that he  never says I give , but I lend, you a good morning . Fro .  That's all very well; but I know the art of fleecing men. I have  a secret of touching their affections by flattering their hearts, and  of finding out their weak points. La Fl .  All useless here. I defy you to soften, as far as money is  concerned, the man we are speaking of. He is a Turk on that point, of  a Turkishness to drive anyone to despair, and we might starve in his  presence and never a peg would he stir. In short, he loves money  better than reputation, honour, and virtue, and the mere sight of  anyone making demands upon his purse sends him into convulsions; it is  like striking him in a vital place, it is piercing him to the heart,  it is like tearing out his very bowels! And if … But here he comes  again; I leave you. SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, FROSINE. Har . ( aside ). All is as it should be.  ( To Frosine ) Well,  what is it, Frosine? Fro .  Bless me, how well you look! You are the very picture of health. Har . Who? I? Fro .  Never have I seen you looking more rosy, more hearty. Har . Are you in earnest? Fro .  Why! you have never been so young in your life; and I know many a  man of twenty-five who looks much older than you do. Har .  And yet, Frosine, I have passed threescore. Fro .  Threescore! Well, and what then? You don't mean to make a trouble  of that, do you? It's the very flower of manhood, the threshold of the  prime of life. Har .  True; but twenty years less would do me no harm, I think. Fro .  Nonsense! You've no need of that, and you are of a build to last  out a hundred. Har .  Do you really think so? Fro .  Decidedly. You have all the appearance of it. Hold yourself up a  little. Ah! what a sign of long life is that line there straight  between your two eyes! Har .  You know all about that, do you? Fro .  I should think I do. Show me your hand. 3 Dear me, what a line of life there is there! Har . Where? Fro .  Don't you see how far this line goes? Har .  Well, and what does it mean? Fro .  What does it mean? There … I said a hundred years; but no, it  is one hundred and twenty I ought to have said. Har . Is it possible? Fro .  I tell you they will have to kill you, and you will bury your  children and your children's children. Har .  So much the better! And what news of our affair? Fro .  Is there any need to ask? Did ever anyone see me begin anything  and not succeed in it? I have, especially for matchmaking, the most  wonderful talent. There are no two persons in the world I could not  couple together; and I believe that, if I took it into my head, I  could make the Grand Turk marry the Republic of  Venice. 4 But we had,  to be sure, no such difficult thing to  achieve in this matter. As I know the ladies very well, I told them  every particular about you; and I acquainted the mother with your  intentions towards Marianne since you saw her pass in the street and  enjoy the fresh air out of her window. Har . What did she answer…? Fro .  She received your proposal with great joy; and when I told her  that you wished very much that her daughter should come to-night to  assist at the marriage contract which is to be signed for your own  daughter, she assented at once, and entrusted her to me for the  purpose. Har .  You see, Frosine, I am obliged to give some supper to Mr.  Anselme, and I should like her to have a share in the feast. Fro .  You are quite right. She is to come after dinner to pay a visit  to your daughter; then she means to go from here to the fair, and  return to your house just in time for supper. Har .  That will do very well; they shall go together in my carriage,  which I will lend them. Fro .  That will suit her perfectly. Har .  But I say, Frosine, have you spoken to the mother about the dowry  she can give her daughter? Did you make her understand that under such  circumstances she ought to do her utmost and to make a great  sacrifice? For, after all, one does not marry a girl without her  bringing something with her. Fro .  How something! She is a girl who will bring you a clear twelve  thousand francs a year? Har . Twelve thousand francs a year? Fro .  Yes! To begin with, she has been nursed and brought up with the  strictest notions of frugality. She is a girl accustomed to live upon  salad, milk, cheese, and apples, and who consequently will require  neither a well served up table, nor any rich broth, nor your  everlasting peeled barley; none, in short, of all those delicacies  that another woman would want. This is no small matter, and may well  amount to three thousand francs yearly. Besides this, she only cares  for simplicity and neatness; she will have none of those splendid  dresses and rich jewels, none of that sumptuous furniture in which  girls like her indulge so extravagantly; and this item is worth more  than four thousand francs per annum. Lastly, she has the deepest  aversion to gambling; and this is not very common nowadays among  women. Why, I know of one in our neighbourhood who lost at least  twenty thousand francs this year. But let us reckon only a fourth of  that sum. Five thousand francs a year at play and four thousand in  clothes and jewels make nine thousand; and three thousand francs which  we count for food, does it not make your twelve thousand francs? Har .  Yes, that's not bad; but, after all, that calculation has nothing  real in it. Fro .  Excuse me; is it nothing real to bring you in marriage a great  sobriety, to inherit a great love for simplicity in dress, and the  acquired property of a great hatred for gambling? Har .  It is a farce to pretend to make up a dowry with all the expenses  she will not run into. I could not give a receipt for what I do not  receive; and I must decidedly get something. Fro .  Bless me! you will get enough; and they have spoken to me of a  certain country where they have some property, of which you will be  master. Har .  We shall have to see to that. But, Frosine, there is one more  thing that makes me uneasy. The girl is young, you know; and young  people generally like those who are young like themselves, and only  care for the society of the young. I am afraid that a man of my age  may not exactly suit her taste, and that this may occasion in my  family certain complications that would in nowise be pleasant to me. Fro .  Oh, how badly you judge her! This is one more peculiarity of  which I had to speak to you. She has the greatest detestation to all  young men, and only likes old people. Har . Does she? Fro .  I should like you to hear her talk on that subject; she cannot  bear at all the sight of a young man, and nothing delights her more  than to see a fine old man with a venerable beard. The oldest are to  her the most charming, and I warn you beforehand not to go and make  yourself any younger than you really are. She wishes for one sixty  years old at least; and it is not more than six months ago that on the  very eve of being married she suddenly broke off the match on learning  that her lover was only fifty-six years of age, and did not put on  spectacles to sign the contract. Har . Only for that? Fro .  Yes; she says there is no pleasure with a man of fifty-six; and  she has a decided affection for those who wear spectacles. Har . Well, this is quite new to me. Fro .  No one can imagine how far she carries this. She has in her room  a few pictures and engravings, and what do you imagine they are? An  Adonis, a Cephalus, a Paris, an Apollo? Not a bit of it! Fine  portraits of Saturn, of King Priam, of old Nestor, and of good father  Anchises on his son's shoulders. Har .  That's admirable. I should never have guessed such a thing; and I  am very pleased to hear that she has such taste as this. Indeed had I  been a woman, I should never have loved young fellows. Fro .  I should think not. Fine trumpery indeed, these young men, for  any one to fall in love with. Fine jackanapes and puppies for a woman  to hanker after. I should like to know what relish anyone can find in  them? Har .  Truly; I don't understand it myself, and I cannot make out how it  is that some women dote so on them. Fro .  They must be downright idiots. Can any one be in his senses who  thinks youth amiable? Can those curly-pated coxcombs be men, and can  one really get attached to such animals? Har .  Exactly what I say every day! With their effeminate voices, their  three little bits of a beard turned up like cat's whiskers, their tow  wigs, their flowing breeches and open breasts! Fro .  Yes; they are famous guys compared with yourself. In you we see  something like a man. There is enough to satisfy the eye. It is thus  that one should be made and dressed to inspire love. Har . Then you think I am pretty well? Fro .  Pretty well! I should think so; you are charming, and your face  would make a beautiful picture. Turn round a little, if you please.  You could not find anything better anywhere. Let me see you walk. You  have a well-shaped body, free and easy, as it should be, and one which  gives no sign of infirmity. Har .  I have nothing the matter to speak of, I am thankful to say. It  is only my cough, which returns from time to  time. 5 Fro .  That is nothing, and coughing becomes you exceedingly well. Har .  Tell me, Frosine, has Marianne seen me yet? Has she not noticed  me when I passed by? Fro .  No; but we have had many conversations about you. I gave her an  exact description of your person, and I did not fail to make the most  of your merit, and to show her what an advantage it would be to have a  husband like you. Har .  You did right, and I thank you very much for it. Fro .  I have, Sir, a small request to make to you. I am in danger of  losing a lawsuit for want of a little money  ( Harpagon looks  grave ), and you can easily help me with it, if you have pity upon  me. You cannot imagine how happy she will be to see you.  ( Harpagon looks joyful .) Oh! how sure you are to please her, and how sure  that antique ruff of yours is to produce a wonderful effect on her  mind. But, above all, she will be delighted with your breeches  fastened to your doublet with tags; that will make her mad after you,  and a lover who wears tags will be most welcome to her. Har .  You send me into raptures, Frosine, by saying that. Fro .  I tell you the truth, Sir; this lawsuit is of the utmost  importance for me. ( Harpagon looks serious again .) If I lose  it, I am for ever ruined; but a very small sum will save me. I should  like you to have seen the happiness she felt when I spoke of you to  her. ( Harpagon looks pleased again .)  Joy sparkled in her eyes  while I told her of all your good qualities; and I succeeded, in  short, in making her look forward with the greatest impatience to the  conclusion of the match. Har .  You have given me great pleasure, Frosine, and I assure you I … Fro .  I beg of you, Sir, to grant me the little assistance I ask of  you. ( Harpagon again looks grave .)  It will put me on my feet  again, and I shall feel grateful to you for ever. Har .  Good-bye; I must go and finish my correspondence. Fro .  I assure you, Sir, that you could not help me in a more pressing  necessity. Har .  I will see that my carriage is ready to take you to the fair. Fro .  I would not importune you so if I were not compelled by  necessity. Har .  And I will see that we have supper early, so that nobody may be  ill. Fro .  Do not refuse me the service; I beg of you. You can hardly  believe, Sir, the pleasure that … Har .  I must go; somebody is calling me. We shall see each other again  by and by. Fro . ( alone ).  May the fever seize you, you stingy cur, and send  you to the devil and his angels! The miser has held out against all my  attacks; but I must not drop the negotiation; for I have the other  side, and there, at all events, I am sure of a good reward. ACT III. SCENE I.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, VALÈRE,  DAME CLAUDE ( holding a  broom ), MASTER JACQUES, LA MERLUCHE, BRINDAVOINE. Har .  Here, come here, all of you; I must give you orders for by and  by, and arrange what each one will have to do. Come nearer, Dame  Claude; let us begin with you. ( Looking at her broom. ) Good;  you are ready armed, I see. To you I commit the care of cleaning up  everywhere; but, above all, be very careful not to rub the furniture  too hard, for fear of wearing it out. Besides this, I put the bottles  under your care during supper, and if any one of them is missing, or  if anything gets broken, you will be responsible for it, and pay it  out of your wages. Jac .  ( aside ). A shrewd punishment that. Har . ( to Dame Claude .) Now you may go. SCENE II.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE,  ÉLISE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES,  BRINDAVOINE, LA MERLUCHE. Har .  To you, Brindavoine, and to you, La Merluche, belongs the duty of  washing the glasses, and of giving to drink, but only when people are  thirsty, and not according to the custom of certain impertinent  lackeys, who urge them to drink, and put the idea into their heads  when they are not thinking about it. Wait until you have been asked  several times, and remember always to have plenty of water. Jac . ( aside ).  Yes; wine without water gets into one's head. La Mer .  Shall we take off our smocks, Sir? Har .  Yes, when you see the guests coming; but be very careful not to  spoil your clothes. Brind .  You know, Sir, that one of the fronts of my doublet is covered  with a large stain of oil from the lamp. La Mer .  And I, Sir, that my breeches are all torn behind, and that,  saving your presence … Har . ( to La Merluche ).  Peace! Turn carefully towards the wall,  and always face the company. ( To Brindavoine , showing him  how he is to hold his hat before his doublet, to hide the stain of  oil ) And you, always hold your hat in this fashion when you wait  on the guests. SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE,  ÉLISE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Har .  As for you, my daughter, you will look after all that is cleared  off the table, and see that nothing is wasted: this care is very  becoming to young girls. Meanwhile get ready to welcome my lady-love,  who is coming this afternoon to pay you a visit, and will take you off  to the fair with her. Do you understand what I say? Eli . Yes, father. SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE,  VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Har .  And you, my young dandy of a son to whom I have the kindness of  forgiving what happened this morning, mind you don't receive her  coldly, or show her a sour face. Cle .  Receive her coldly! And why should I? Har .  Why? why? We know pretty well the ways of children whose fathers  marry again, and the looks they give to those we call stepmothers. But  if you wish me to forget your last offence, I advise you, above all  things, to receive her kindly, and, in short, to give her the  heartiest welcome you can. Cle .  To speak the truth, father, I cannot promise you that I am very  happy to see her become my stepmother; but as to receiving her  properly, and as to giving her a kind welcome, I promise to obey you  in that to the very letter. Har .  Be careful you do, at least. Cle .  You will see that you have no cause to complain. Har . You will do wisely. SCENE V.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Har .  Valère, you will have to give me your help in this business. Now,  Master Jacques, I kept you for the last. Jac .  Is it to your coachman, Sir, or to your cook you want to speak,  for I am both the one and the other? Har . To both. Jac .  But to which of the two first? Har . To the cook. Jac .  Then wait a minute, if you please. ( Jacques takes off his stable-coat and appears dressed as a  cook. ) Har .  What the deuce is the meaning of this ceremony? Jac . Now I am at your service. Har .  I have engaged myself, Master Jacques, to give a supper to-night. Jac . ( aside ). Wonderful! Har . Tell me, can you give us a good supper? Jac . Yes, if you give me plenty of money. Har .  The deuce! Always money! I think they have nothing else to say  except money, money, money! Always that same word in their mouth,  money! They always speak of money! It's their pillow companion, money! Val .  Never did I hear such an impertinent answer! Would you call it  wonderful to provide good cheer with plenty of money? Is it not the  easiest thing in the world? The most stupid could do as much. But a  clever man should talk of a good supper with little money. Jac .  A good supper with little money? Val . Yes. Jac .  ( to Valère ).  Indeed, Mr. Steward, you will oblige me  greatly by telling me your secret, and also, if you like, by filling  my place as cook; for you keep on meddling here, and want to be  everything. Har .  Hold your tongue. What shall we want? Jac .  Ask that of Mr. Steward, who will give you good cheer with little  money. Har .  Do you hear? I am speaking to you, and expect you to answer me. Jac .  How many will there be at your table? Har .  Eight or ten; but you must only reckon for eight. When there is  enough for eight, there is enough for ten. Val . That is evident. Jac .  Very well, then; you must have four tureens of soup and five side  dishes; soups, entrées … Har .  What! do you mean to feed a whole town? Jac . Roast … Har . ( clapping his hand on Master Jacques' mouth ). Ah!  Wretch! you are eating up all my substance. Jac . Entremêts … Har . ( again putting his hand on Jacques' mouth ). More  still? Val . ( to Jacques ).  Do you mean to kill everybody? And has your  master invited people in order to destroy them with over-feeding? Go  and read a little the precepts of health, and ask the doctors if there  is anything so hurtful to man as excess in eating. Har . He is perfectly right. Val .  Know, Master Jacques, you and people like you, that a table  overloaded with eatables is a real cut-throat; that, to be the true  friends of those we invite, frugality should reign throughout the  repast we give, and that according to the saying of one of the  ancients, \"We must eat to live, and not live to eat.\" Har .  Ah! How well the man speaks! Come near, let me embrace you for  this last saying. It is the finest sentence that I have ever heard in  my life: \"We must live to eat, and not eat to live.\" No; that isn't  it. How do you say it? Val .  That we must eat to live, and not live to eat. Har .  ( to Master Jacques ).  Yes. Do you hear that? ( To Valère )  Who is the great man who said that? Val .  I do not exactly recollect his name just now. Har .  Remember to write down those words for me. I will have them  engraved in letters of gold over the mantel-piece of my dining-room. Val .  I will not fail. As for your supper, you had better let me manage  it. I will see that it is all as it should be. Har . Do so. Jac .  So much the better; all the less work for me. Har . ( to Valère ).  We must have some of those things of which it  is not possible to eat much, and that satisfy directly. Some good fat  beans, and a pâté well stuffed with chestnuts. Val . Trust to me. Har .  Now, Master Jacques, you must clean my carriage. Jac . Wait a moment; this is to the coachman.  ( Jacques puts on his  coat. ) You say … Har .  That you must clean my carriage, and have my horses ready to  drive to the fair. Jac .  Your horses! Upon my word, Sir, they are not at all in a  condition to stir. I won't tell you that they are laid up, for the  poor things have got nothing to lie upon, and it would not be telling  the truth. But you make them keep such rigid fasts that they are  nothing but phantoms, ideas, and mere shadows of horses. Har .  They are much to be pitied. They have nothing to do. Jac .  And because they have nothing to do, must they have nothing to  eat? It would be much better for them, poor things, to work much and  eat to correspond. It breaks my heart to see them so reduced; for, in  short, I love my horses; and when I see them suffer, it seems as if it  were myself. Every day I take the bread out of my own mouth to feed  them; and it is being too hard-hearted, Sir, to have no compassion  upon one's neighbour. Har .  It won't be very hard work to go to the fair. Jac .  No, Sir. I haven't the heart to drive them; it would go too much  against my conscience to use the whip to them in the state they are  in. How could you expect them to drag a carriage? They have not even  strength enough to drag themselves along. Val .  Sir, I will ask our neighbour, Picard, to drive them;  particularly as we shall want his help to get the supper ready. Jac .  Be it so. I had much rather they should die under another's hand  than under mine. Val .  Master Jacques is mightily considerate. Jac .  Mr. Steward is mightily indispensable. Har . Peace. Jac .  Sir, I can't bear these flatteries, and I can see that, whatever  this man does, his continual watching after the bread, wine, wood,  salt, and candles, is done but to curry favour and to make his court  to you. I am indignant to see it all; and I am sorry to hear every day  what is said of you; for, after all, I have a certain tenderness for  you; and, except my horses, you are the person I like most in the  world. Har .  And I would know from you, Master Jacques, what it is that is  said of me. Jac .  Yes, certainly, Sir, if I were sure you would not get angry with  me. Har .  No, no; never fear. Jac .  Excuse me, but I am sure you will be angry. Har .  No, on the contrary, you will oblige me. I should be glad to know  what people say of me. Jac .  Since you wish it, Sir, I will tell you frankly that you are the  laughing-stock of everybody; that they taunt us everywhere by a  thousand jokes on your account, and that nothing delights people more  than to make sport of you, and to tell stories without end about your  stinginess. One says that you have special almanacks printed, where  you double the ember days and vigils, so that you may profit by the  fasts to which you bind all your house; another, that you always have  a ready-made quarrel for your servants at Christmas time or when they  leave you, so that you may give them nothing. One tells a story how  not long since you prosecuted a neighbour's cat because it had eaten  up the remainder of a leg of mutton; another says that one night you  were caught stealing your horses' oats, and that your coachman,—that  is the man who was before me,—gave you, in the dark, a good sound  drubbing, of which you said nothing. In short, what is the use of  going on? We can go nowhere but we are sure to hear you pulled to  pieces. You are the butt and jest and byword of everybody; and never  does anyone mention you but under the names of miser, stingy, mean,  niggardly fellow and usurer. Har . ( beating Jacques ). You are a fool, a rascal, a scoundrel,  and an impertinent wretch. Jac .  There, there! Did not I know how it would be? You would not  believe me. I told you I should make you angry if I spoke the truth? Har . Learn how to speak. SCENE VI.——VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Val . ( laughing ).  Well, Master Jacques, your frankness is badly  rewarded, I fear. Jac .  S'death! Mr. Upstart, you who assume the man of consequence, it  is no business of yours as far as I can see. Laugh at your own  cudgelling when you get it, and don't come here and laugh at mine. Val .  Ah! Master Jacques, don't get into a passion, I beg of you. Jac . ( aside ).  He is drawing in his horns. I will put on a bold  face, and if he is fool enough to be afraid of me, I will pay him back  somewhat. ( To Valère )  Do you know, Mr. Grinner, that I am not  exactly in a laughing humour, and that if you provoke me too much, I  shall make you laugh after another fashion.  ( Jacques pushes Valère to the farther end of the stage, threatening him. ) Val .  Gently, gently. Jac .  How gently? And if it does not please me to go gently? Val .  Come, come! What are you about? Jac .  You are an impudent rascal. Val .  Master Jacques … Jac .  None of your Master Jacques here! If I take up a stick, I shall  soon make you feel it. Val .  What do you mean by a stick? ( Drives back Jacques in  his turn. ) Jac .  No; I don't say anything about that. Val .  Do you know, Mr. Conceit, that I am a man to give you a drubbing  in good earnest? Jac .  I have no doubt of it. Val .  That, after all, you are nothing but a scrub of a cook? Jac . I know it very well. Val .  And that you don't know me yet? Jac . I beg your pardon. Val .  You will beat me, you say? Jac . I only spoke in jest. Val .  I don't like your jesting, and ( beating Jacques ) remember  that you are but a sorry hand at it. Jac . ( alone ).  Plague take all sincerity; it is a bad trade. I  give it up for the future, and will cease to tell the truth. It is all  very well for my master to beat me; but as for that Mr. Steward, what  right has he to do it? I will be revenged on him if I can. SCENE VII.——MARIANNE, FROSINE, MASTER JACQUES. Fro .  Do you know if your master is at home? Jac .  Yes, he is indeed; I know it but too well. Fro .  Tell him, please, that we are here. SCENE VIII.——MARIANNE, FROSINE. Mar .  Ah! Frosine, how strange I feel, and how I dread this interview! Fro .  Why should you? What can you possibly dread? Mar .  Alas! can you ask me? Can you not understand the alarms of a  person about to see the instrument of torture to which she is to be  tied. Fro .  I see very well that to die agreeably, Harpagon is not the  torture you would embrace; and I can judge by your looks that the fair  young man you spoke of to me is still in your thoughts. Mar .  Yes, Frosine; it is a thing I do not wish to deny. The respectful  visits he has paid at our house have left, I confess, a great  impression on my heart. Fro .  But do you know who he is? Mar .  No, I do not. All I know is that he is made to be loved; that if  things were left to my choice, I would much rather marry him than any  other, and that he adds not a little to the horrible dread that I have  of the husband they want to force upon me. Fro .  Oh yes! All those dandies are very pleasant, and can talk  agreeably enough, but most of them are as poor as church mice; and it  is much better for you to marry an old husband, who gives you plenty  of money. I fully acknowledge that the senses somewhat clash with the  end I propose, and that there are certain little inconveniences to be  endured with such a husband; but all that won't last; and his death,  believe me, will soon put you in a position to take a more pleasant  husband, who will make amends for all. Mar .  Oh, Frosine! What a strange state of things that, in order to be  happy, we must look forward to the death of another. Yet death will  not fall in with all the projects we make. Fro .  You are joking. You marry him with the express understanding that  he will soon leave you a widow; it must be one of the articles of the  marriage contract. It would be very wrong in him not to die before  three months are over. Here he is himself. Mar . Ah! dear Frosine, what a face! SCENE IX.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, FROSINE. Har . ( to Marianne ). Do not be offended, fair one, if I come to  you with my glasses on. I know that your beauty is great enough to be  seen with the naked eye; but, still, it is with glasses that we look  at the stars, and I maintain and uphold that you are a star, the most  beautiful and in the land of stars. Frosine, she does not answer,  star, it seems to me, shows no joy at the sight of me. Fro .  It is because she is still quite awe-struck, and young girls are  always shy at first, and afraid of showing what they feel. Har .  ( to Frosine ). You are right.  ( To Marianne ) My  pretty darling, there is my daughter coming to welcome you. SCENE X.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, FROSINE. Mar .  I am very late in acquitting myself of the visit I owed you. Eli .  You have done what I ought to have done. It was for me to have  come and seen you first. Har .  You see what a great girl she is; but ill weeds grow apace. Mar . ( aside to Frosine ). Oh, what an unpleasant man! Har . ( to Frosine ). What does my fair one say? Fro . That she thinks you perfect. Har .  You do me too much honour, my adorable darling. Mar .  ( aside ). What a dreadful creature! Har .  I really feel too grateful to you for these sentiments. Mar . ( aside ). I can bear it no longer. SCENE XI.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE,  VALÈRE, FROSINE, BRINDAVOINE. Har .  Here is my son, who also comes to pay his respects to you. Mar .  ( aside to Frosine ).  Oh, Frosine! what a strange meeting!  He is the very one of whom I spoke to you. Fro . ( to Marianne ). Well, that is extraordinary. Har .  You are surprised to see that my children can be so old; but I  shall soon get rid of both of them. Cle . ( to Marianne ). Madam, to tell you the truth, I little  expected such an event; and my father surprised me not a little when  he told me to-day of the decision he had come to. Mar .  I can say the same thing. It is an unexpected meeting; and I  certainly was far from being prepared for such an event. Cle .  Madam, my father cannot make a better choice, and it is a great  joy to me to have the honour of welcoming you here. At the same time,  I cannot say that I should rejoice if it were your intention to become  my stepmother. I must confess that I should find it difficult to pay  you the compliment; and it is a title, forgive me, that I cannot wish  you to have. To some this speech would seem coarse, but I feel that  you understand it. This marriage, Madam, is altogether repugnant to  me. You are not ignorant, now that you know who I am, how opposed it  is to all my own interests, and with my father's permission I hope you  will allow me to say that, if things depended on me, it would never  take place. Har . ( aside ).  What a very impertinent speech to make; and what  a confession to make to her! Mar .  And as my answer, I must tell you that things are much the same  with me, and that, if you have any repugnance in seeing me your  stepmother, I shall have no less in seeing you my stepson. Do not  believe, I beg of you, that it is of my own will that this trouble has  come upon you. I should be deeply grieved to cause you the least  sorrow, and unless I am forced to it by a power I must obey, I give  you my word that, I will never consent to a marriage which is so  painful to you. Har .  She is right. A foolish speech deserves a foolish answer. I beg  your pardon, my love, for the impertinence of my son. He is a silly  young fellow, who has not yet learnt the value of his own words. Mar .  I assure you that he has not at all offended me. I am thankful,  on the contrary, that he has spoken so openly. I care greatly for such  a confession from him, and if he had spoken differently, I should feel  much less esteem for him. Har .  It is very kind of you to excuse him thus. Time will make him  wiser, and you will see that his feelings will change. Cle .  No, father, they will never change; and I earnestly beg of you,  Madam, to believe me. Har .  Did ever anybody see such folly? He is becoming worse and worse. Cle .  Would you have me false to my inmost feelings? Har .  Again! Change your manners, if you please. Cle .  Very well, since you wish me to speak differently. Allow me,  Madam, to take for a moment my father's place; and forgive me if I  tell you that I never saw in the world anybody more charming than you  are; that I can understand no happiness to equal that of pleasing you,  and that to be your husband is a glory, a felicity, I should prefer to  the destinies of the greatest princes upon earth. Yes, Madam, to  possess you is, in my mind, to possess the best of all treasures; to  obtain you is all my ambition. There is nothing I would not do for so  precious a conquest, and the most powerful obstacles … Har .  Gently, gently, my son, if you please. Cle .  These are complimentary words which I speak to her in your name. Har .  Bless me! I have a tongue of my own to explain my feelings, and I  really don't care for such an advocate as you … Here, bring us some  chairs. Fro .  No; I think it is better for us to go at once to the fair, in  order to be back earlier, and have plenty of time for talking. Har . ( to Brindavoine ). Have the carriage ready at once. SCENE XII.——HARPAGON,  MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE. Har . ( to Marianne ).  I hope you will excuse me, my dear, but I  forgot to order some refreshments for you, before you went out. Cle .  I have thought of it, father, and have ordered to be brought in  here some baskets of China oranges, sweet citrons, and preserves,  which I sent for in your name. Har . ( aside, to Valère ). Valère! Val . ( aside, to Harpagon ). He has lost his senses! Cle .  You are afraid, father, that it will not be enough? I hope,  Madam, that you will have the kindness to excuse it. Mar .  It was by no means necessary. Cle .  Did you ever see, Madam, a more brilliant diamond than the one my  father has upon his finger? Mar .  It certainly sparkles very much. Cle .  ( taking the diamond off his father's finger ). You must see  it near. Mar .  It is a beautiful one; it possesses great lustre. Cle . ( steps before Marianne , who wants to restore it ).  No, Madam, it is in hands too beautiful; it is a present my father  gives you. Har . I? Cle .  Is it not true, father, that you wish her to keep it for your  sake? Har .  ( aside, to his son ). What? Cle .  ( to Marianne ).  A strange question indeed! He is making me  signs that I am to force you to accept it. Mar . I would not … Cle . ( to Marianne ).  I beg of you…. He would not take it back. Har .  ( aside ). I am bursting with rage! Mar .  It would be … Cle . ( still hindering Marianne from returning it ). No; I  tell you, you will offend him. Mar . Pray … Cle . By no means. Har .  ( aside ). Plague take … Cle .  He is perfectly shocked at your refusal. Har .  ( aside, to his son ). Ah! traitor! Cle .  ( to Marianne ).  You see he is in despair. Har .  ( aside, to his son, threatening him ). You villain! Cle .  Really, father, it is not my fault. I do all I can to persuade  her to accept it; but she is obstinate. Har .  ( in a rage, aside to his son ). Rascal! Cle .  You are the cause, Madam, of my father scolding me. Har .  ( aside, with the same looks ). Scoundrel! Cle .  ( to Marianne ).  You will make him ill; for goodness' sake,  hesitate no longer. Fro .  ( to Marianne ).  Why so much ceremony? Keep the ring, since  the gentleman wishes you to. Mar .  ( to Harpagon ).  I will keep it now, Sir, in order not to  make you angry, and I shall take another opportunity of returning it  to you. SCENE XIII.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE,  VALÈRE, FROSINE, BRINDAVOINE. Brind .  Sir, there is a gentleman here who wants to speak to you. Har .  Tell him that I am engaged, and that I cannot see him to-day. Brind .  He says he has some money for you. Har . ( to Marianne ).  Pray, excuse me; I will come back directly. SCENE XIV.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE,  ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, FROSINE, LA MERLUCHE. La Mer .  ( comes in running, and throws Harpagon down ).  Sir … Har . Oh! he has killed me. Cle .  What's the matter, father? Have you hurt yourself? Har .  The wretch must have been bribed by some of my debtors to break  my neck. Val .  ( to Harpagon ).  There is nothing serious. La Mer .  ( to Harpagon ).  I beg your pardon, Sir; I thought I had  better run fast to tell you…. Har . What? La Mer .  That your two horses have lost their shoes. Har .  Take them quickly to the smith. Cle .  In the meantime, father, I will do the honours of the house for  you, and take this lady into the garden, where lunch will be brought. SCENE XV.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE. Har .  Valère, look after all this; and take care, I beseech you, to  save as much of it as you can, so that we may send it back to the  tradesman again. Val . I will. Har .  ( alone ). Miscreant! do you mean to ruin me? ACT IV. SCENE I.——CLÉANTE, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, FROSINE. Cle .  Let us come in here; we shall be much better. There is no one  about us that we need be afraid of, and we can speak openly. Eli .  Yes, Madam, my brother has told me of the love he has for you. I  know what sorrow and anxiety such trials as these may cause, and I  assure you that I have the greatest sympathy for you. Mar .  I feel it a great comfort in my trouble to have the sympathy of a  person like you, and I entreat you, Madam, ever to retain for me a  friendship so capable of softening the cruelty of my fate. Fro .  You really are both very unfortunate not to have told me of all  this before. I might certainly have warded off the blow, and not have  carried things so far. Cle .  What could I do? It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.  But you, fair Marianne, what have you resolved to do? What resolution  have you taken? Mar .  Alas! Is it in my power to take any resolution? And, dependent as  I am, can I do anything else except form wishes? Cle .  No other support for me in your heart? Nothing but mere wishes?  No pitying energy? No kindly relief? No active affection? Mar .  What am I to say to you? Put yourself in my place, and judge what  I can possibly do. Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely  to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what  is modest and seemly. Cle .  Alas! to what do you reduce me when you wish me to be guided  entirely by feelings of strict duty and of scrupulous propriety. Mar .  But what would you have me do? Even if I were, for you, to divest  myself of the many scruples which our sex imposes on us, I have too  much regard for my mother, who has brought me up with great  tenderness, for me to give her any cause of sorrow. Do all you can  with her. Strive to win her. I give you leave to say and do all you  wish; and if anything depends upon her knowing the true state of my  feelings, by all means tell her what they are; indeed I will do it  myself if necessary. Cle .  Frosine, dear Frosine, will you not help us? Fro .  Indeed, I should like to do so, as you know. I am not naturally  unkind. Heaven has not given me a heart of flint, and I feel but too  ready to help when I see young people loving each other in all  earnestness and honesty. What can we do in this case? Cle .  Try and think a little. Mar . Advise us. Eli .  Invent something to undo what you have done. Fro .  Rather a difficult piece of business.  ( To Marianne ) As far  as your mother is concerned, she is not altogether unreasonable and we  might succeed in making her give to the son the gift she reserved for  the father. ( To Cléante )  But the most disheartening part of it  all is that your father is your father. Cle . Yes, so it is. Fro .  I mean that he will bear malice if he sees that he is refused,  and he will be in no way disposed afterwards to give his consent to  your marriage. It would be well if the refusal could be made to come  from him, and you ought to try by some means or other to make him  dislike you, Marianne. Cle . You are quite right. Fro .  Yes, right enough, no doubt. That is what ought to be done; but  how in the world are we to set about it? Wait a moment. Suppose we had  a somewhat elderly woman with a little of the ability which I possess,  and able sufficiently well to represent a lady of rank, by means of a  retinue made up in haste, and of some whimsical title of a marchioness  or viscountess, whom we would suppose to come from Lower Brittany. I  should have enough power over your father to persuade him that she is  a rich woman, in possession, besides her houses, of a hundred thousand  crowns in ready money; that she is deeply in love with him, and that  she would marry him at any cost, were she even to give him all her  money by the marriage contract. I have no doubt he would listen to the  proposal. For certainly he loves you very much, my dear, but he loves  money still better. When once he has consented to your marriage, it  does not signify much how he finds out the true state of affairs about  our marchioness. Cle .  All that is very well made up. Fro .  Leave it to me; I just remember one of my friends who will do  beautifully. Cle .  Depend on my gratitude, Frosine, if you succeed. But, dear  Marianne, let us begin, I beg of you, by gaining over your mother; it  would be a great deal accomplished if this marriage were once broken  off. Make use, I beseech you, of all the power that her tenderness for  you gives you over her. Display without hesitation those eloquent  graces, those all-powerful charms, with which Heaven has endowed your  eyes and lips; forget not, I beseech you, those sweet persuasions,  those tender entreaties, those loving caresses to which, I feel,  nothing could be refused. Mar .  I will do all I can, and will forget nothing. SCENE II.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, FROSINE. Har . ( aside, and without being seen ).  Ah! ah! my son is kissing the  hand of his intended stepmother, and his intended stepmother does not  seem much averse to it! Can there be any mystery in all this? Eli .  Here comes my father. Har .  The carriage is quite ready, and you can start when you like. Cle .  Since you are not going, father, allow me to take care of them. Har .  No, stop here; they can easily take care of themselves, and I  want you. SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE. Har .  Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do  you think of this lady? Cle .  What I think of her? Har .  Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty  and intelligence? Cle . So, so. Har . But still? Cle .  To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her  manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward,  her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order.  Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must  have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any  other. Har .  You spoke to her just now, nevertheless…. Cle .  I paid her several compliments in your name, but it was to please  you. Har .  So then you don't care for her? Cle . Who? I? Not in the least. Har .  I am sorry for it, for that puts an end to a scheme which had  occurred to me. Since I have seen her here, I have been thinking of my  own age; and I feel that people would find fault with me for marrying  so young a girl. This consideration had made me determine to abandon  the project, and as I had demanded her in marriage, and had given her  my promise, I would have given her to you if it were not for the  dislike you have for her. Cle . To me? Har . To you. Cle . In marriage? Har . In marriage. Cle .  It is true she is not at all to my taste; but, to please you,  father, I will bring myself to marry her, if you please. Har .  If I please! I am more reasonable than you think. I don't wish to  compel you. Cle .  Excuse me! I will make an attempt to love her. Har .  No, no; a marriage cannot be happy where there is no love. Cle .  That, my father, will, perhaps, come by and by, and it is said  that love is often the fruit of marriage. Har .  No, it is not right to risk it on the side of the man, and there  are some troublesome things I don't care to run the chance of. If you  had felt any inclination for her, you should have married her instead  of me, but as it is, I will return to my first intention and marry her  myself. Cle .  Well, father, since things are so, I had better be frank with  you, and reveal our secret to you. The truth is that I have loved her  ever since I saw her one day on the promenade. I intended to ask you  today to let me marry her, and I was only deterred from it because you  spoke of marrying her, and because I feared to displease you. Har .  Have you ever paid her any visits? Cle . Yes, father. Har . Many? Cle .  Yes; considering how long we have been acquainted. Har . You were well received. Cle .  Very well, but without her knowing who I was; and that is why  Marianne was so surprised when she saw me today. Har .  Have you told her of your love, and of your intention of marrying  her? Cle .  Certainly, and I also spoke a little to the mother on the  subject. Har .  Did she kindly receive your proposal for her daughter? Cle . Yes, very kindly. Har .  And does the daughter return your love? Cle .  If I can believe appearances, she is certainly well disposed  towards me. Har .  ( aside ). Well! I am very glad to have found out this  secret; it is the very thing I wanted to know. ( To his son )  Now, look here, my son, I tell you what. You will have, if you please,  to get rid of your love for Marianne, to cease to pay your attentions  to a person I intend for myself, and to marry very soon the wife I  have chosen for you. Cle .  So, father, it is thus you deceive me! Very well, since things  are come to such a pass, I openly declare to you that I shall not give  up my love for Marianne. No! understand that henceforth there is  nothing from which I shall shrink in order to dispute her with you;  and if you have on your side the consent of the mother, perhaps I  shall have some other resources left to aid me. Har .  What, rascal! You dare to trespass on my grounds? Cle .  It is you who trespass on mine. I was the first. Har .  Am I not your father, and do you not owe me respect? Cle .  There are things in which children are not called upon to pay  deference to their fathers; and love is no respector of persons. Har .  My stick will make you know me better. Cle .  All your threatenings are nothing to me. Har . You will give up Marianne? Cle . Never! Har .  Bring me my stick. Quick, I say! my stick! SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, MASTER JACQUES. Jac .  Hold! hold! Gentlemen, what does this mean? What are you thinking  of? Cle .  I don't care a bit for it. Jac .  ( to Cléante ). Ah! Sir, gently. Har .  He dares to speak to me with such impudence as that! Jac .  ( to Harpagon ). Ah! Sir, I beg of you. Cle . I shall keep to it. Jac .  ( to Cléante ).  What! to your father? Har . Let me do it. Jac .  ( to Harpagon ).  What! to your son? To me it's different. Har .  I will make you judge between us, Master Jacques, so that you may  see that I have right on my side. Jac . Willingly.  ( To Cléante )  Go a little farther back. Har .  There is a young girl I love and want to marry, and the scoundrel  has the impudence to love her also, and wants to marry her in spite of  me. Jac . Oh! he is wrong. Har .  Is it not an abominable thing to see a son who does not shrink  from becoming the rival of his father? And is it not his bounden duty  to refrain from interfering with my love? Jac .  You are quite right; stop here, and let me go and speak to him. Cle .  ( to Master Jacques , who comes near him ). Very well;  if he wants to make you a judge between us, I have no objection. I  care little who it is, and I don't mind referring our quarrel to you. Jac . You do me great honour. Cle .  I am in love with a young girl who returns my affection, and who  receives kindly the offer of my heart; but my father takes it into his  head to disturb our love by asking her in marriage. Jac .  He certainly is wrong. Cle .  Is it not shameful for a man of his age to think of marrying? I  ask you if it is right for him to fall in love? and ought he not now  to leave that to younger men? Jac .  You are quite right; he is not serious; let me speak a word or  two to him. ( To Harpagon )  Really, your son is not so extravagant  as you think, and is amenable to reason. He says that he is conscious  of the respect he owes you, and that he only got angry in the heat of  the moment. He will willingly submit to all you wish if you will only  promise to treat him more kindly than you do, and will give him in  marriage a person to his taste. Har .  Ah! tell him, Master Jacques, that he will obtain everything from  me on those terms, and that, except Marianne, I leave him free to  choose for his wife whomsoever he pleases. Jac . Leave that to me.  ( To Cléante )  Really, your father is not  so unreasonable as you make him out to me; and he tells me that it is  your violence which irritated him. He only objects to your way of  doing things, and is quite ready to grant you all you want, provided  you will use gentle means and will give him the deference, respect,  and submission that a son owes to his father. Cle .  Ah! Master Jacques, you can assure him that if he grants me  Marianne, he will always find me the most submissive of men, and that  I shall never do anything contrary to his pleasure. Jac .  ( to Harpagon ).  It's all right; he consents to what you  say. Har . Nothing could be better. Jac .  ( to Cléante ).  It's all settled; he is satisfied with your  promises. Cle . Heaven be praised! Jac .  Gentlemen, you have nothing to do but to talk quietly over the  matter together; you are agreed now, and yet you were on the point of  quarrelling through want of understanding each other. Cle .  My poor Jacques, I shall be obliged to you all my life. Jac .  Don't mention it, Sir. Har .  You have given me great pleasure, Master Jacques, and deserve a  reward. ( Harpagon feels in his pocket , Jacques holds out his  hand, but Harpagon only pulls out his handkerchief, and  says ,) Go; I will remember it, I promise you. Jac . I thank you kindly, Sir. SCENE V.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE. Cle .  I beg your pardon, father, for having been angry. Har .  It is nothing. Cle .  I assure you that I feel very sorry about it. Har .  I am very happy to see you reasonable again. Cle .  How very kind of you so soon to forget my fault. Har .  One easily forgets the faults of children when they return to  their duty. Cle .  What! you are not angry with me for my extravagant behaviour? Har .  By your submission and respectful conduct you compel me to forget  my anger. Cle .  I assure you, father, I shall for ever keep in heart the  remembrance of all your kindness. Har .  And I promise you that, in future, you will obtain all you like  from me. Cle .  Oh, father! I ask nothing more; it is sufficient for me that you  give me Marianne. Har . What? Cle .  I say, father, that I am only too thankful already for what you  have done, and that when you give me Marianne, you give me everything. Har .  Who talks of giving you Marianne? Cle . You, father. Har . I? Cle . Yes. Har .  What! is it not you who promised to give her up? Cle . I! give her up? Har . Yes. Cle .  Certainly not. Har .  Did you not give up all pretensions to her? Cle .  On the contrary, I am more determined than ever to have her. Har .  What, scoundrel! again? Cle .  Nothing can make me change my mind. Har .  Let me get at you again, wretch! Cle . You can do as you please. Har .  I forbid you ever to come within my sight. Cle . As you like. Har . I abandon you. Cle . Abandon me. Har . I disown you. Cle . Disown me. Har . I disinherit you. Cle . As you will. Har .  I give you my curse. Cle .  I want none of your gifts. SCENE VI.——CLÉANTE, LA FLÈCHE. La Fl .  ( leaving the garden with a casket ). Ah! Sir, you are  just in the nick of time. Quick! follow me. Cle . What is the matter? La Fl .  Follow me, I say. We are saved. Cle . How? La Fl .  Here is all you want. Cle . What? La Fl .  I have watched for this all day. Cle . What is it? La Fl .  Your father's treasure that I have got hold of. Cle .  How did you manage it? La Fl .  I will tell you all about it. Let us be off. I can hear him  calling out. SCENE VII.——HARPAGON, from the garden, rushing in without his hat,  and crying — Thieves! thieves! assassins! murder! Justice, just heavens! I am  undone; I am murdered; they have cut my throat; they have stolen my  money! Who can it be? What has become of him? Where is he? Where is he  hiding himself? What shall I do to find him? Where shall I run? Where  shall I not run? Is he not here? Who is this? Stop! ( To himself,  taking hold of his own arm ) Give me back my money, wretch….  Ah…! it is myself…. My mind is wandering, and I know not where I  am, who I am, and what I am doing. Alas! my poor money! my poor money!  my dearest friend, they have bereaved me of thee; and since thou art  gone, I have lost my support, my consolation, and my joy. All is ended  for me, and I have nothing more to do in the world! Without thee it is  impossible for me to live. It is all over with me; I can bear it no  longer. I am dying; I am dead; I am buried. Is there nobody who will  call me from the dead, by restoring my dear money to me, or by telling  me who has taken it? Ah! what is it you say? It is no one. Whoever has  committed the deed must have watched carefully for his opportunity,  and must have chosen the very moment when I was talking with my  miscreant of a son. I must go. I will demand justice, and have the  whole of my house put to the torture—my maids and my valets, my son,  my daughter, and myself too. What a crowd of people are assembled  here! Everyone seems to be my thief. I see no one who does not rouse  suspicion in me. Ha! what are they speaking of there? Of him who stole  my money? What noise is that up yonder? Is it my thief who is there?  For pity's sake, if you know anything of my thief, I beseech you to  tell me. Is he hiding there among you? They all look at me and laugh.  We shall see that they all have a share in the robbery. Quick!  magistrates, police, provosts, judges, racks, gibbets, and  executioners. I will hang everybody, and if I do not find my money, I  will hang myself afterwards. ACT V. SCENE I.——HARPAGON, A POLICE OFFICER. Off .  Leave that to me. I know my business. Thank Heaven! this is not  the first time I have been employed in finding out thieves; and I wish  I had as many bags of a thousand francs as I have had people hanged. Har .  Every magistrate must take this affair in hand; and if my money  is not found, I shall call justice against justice itself. Off .  We must take all needful steps. You say there was in that  casket…? Har .  Ten thousand crowns in cash. Off .  Ten thousand crowns! Har .  Ten thousand crowns. Off .  A considerable theft. Har .  There is no punishment great enough for the enormity of the  crime; and if it remain unpunished, the most sacred things are no  longer secure. Off .  In what coins was that sum? Har .  In good louis d'or and pistoles of full weight. Off .  Whom do you suspect of this robbery? Har .  Everybody. I wish you to take into custody the whole town and  suburbs. Off .  You must not, if you trust me, frighten anybody, but must use  gentle means to collect evidence, in order afterwards to proceed with  more rigour for the recovery of the sum which has been taken from you. SCENE II.——HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES. Jac .  ( at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he  came in ). I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his  feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling. Har . What! Him who has robbed me? Jac .  I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent  me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy. Har .  This is no longer the question; and you have to speak of  something else to this gentleman. Off . ( to Jacques ). Don't get frightened. I am not a man to  cause any scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means. Jac . ( to Harpagon ). Is this gentleman coming to supper with  you? Off .  You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your  master. Jac .  Indeed, Sir, I will show you all I know, and will treat you in  the best manner I possibly can. Off .  That's not the question. Jac .  If I do not give as good fare as I should like, it is the fault  of your steward, who has clipped my wings with the scissors of his  economy. Har. Rascal! We have other matters to talk about than your supper; and  I want you to tell me what has become of the money which has been  stolen from me. Jac .  Some money has been stolen from you? Har .  Yes, you rascal! And I'll have you hanged if you don't give it me  back again. Off . ( to Harpagon ).  Pray, don't be hard upon him. I see by his  looks that he is an honest fellow, and that he will tell you all you  want to know without going to prison. Yes, my friend, if you confess,  no harm shall come to you, and you shall be well rewarded by your  master. Some money has been stolen from him, and it is not possible  that you know nothing about it. Jac . ( aside ).  The very thing I wanted in order to be revenged  of our steward. Ever since he came here, he has been the favourite,  and his advice is the only one listened to. Moreover, I have forgotten  neither the cudgelling of to-day nor … Har .  What are you muttering about there? Off . ( to Harpagon ).  Leave him alone. He is preparing himself to  satisfy you; I told you that he was an honest fellow. Jac .  Sir, since you want me to tell you what I know, I believe it is  your steward who has done this. Har . Valère? Jac . Yes. Har .  He who seemed so faithful to me! Jac .  Himself. I believe that it is he who has robbed you. Har .  And what makes you believe it? Jac .  What makes me believe it? Har . Yes. Jac .  I believe it … because I believe it. Off .  But you must tell us the proofs you have. Har .  Did you see him hanging about the place where I had put my money? Jac . Yes, indeed. Where was your money? Har . In the garden. Jac .  Exactly; I saw him loitering about in the garden; and in what was  your money? Har .  In a casket. Jac .  The very thing. I saw him with a casket. Har .  And this casket, what was it like? I shall soon see if it is  mine. Jac .  What it was like? Har . Yes. Jac .  It was like … like a casket. Off .  Of course. But describe it a little, to see if it is the same. Jac .  It was a large casket. Har .  The one taken from me is a small one. Jac .  Yes, small if you look at it in that way; but I call it large  because of what it contains. Har .  And what colour was it? Jac . What colour? Off . Yes. Jac .  Of a colour … of a certain colour…. Can't you help me to find  the word? Har . Ugh! Jac . Red; isn't it? Har . No, grey. Jac .  Ha! yes, reddish-grey! That's what I meant. Har .  There is no doubt about it, it's my casket for certain. Write  down his evidence, Sir! Heavens! whom can we trust after that? We must  never swear to anything, and I believe now that I might rob my own  self. Jac .  ( to Harpagon ).  There he is coming back, Sir; I beg of you  not to go and tell him that it was I who let it all out, Sir. SCENE III.——HARPAGON,  THE POLICE OFFICER, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES. Har .  Come, come near, and confess the most abominable action, the most  horrible crime, that was ever committed. Val .  What do you want, Sir? Har .  What, wretch! you do not blush for shame after such a crime? Val .  Of what crime do you speak? Har .  Of what crime I speak? Base villain, as if you did not know what  I mean! It is in vain for you to try to hide it; the thing is  discovered, and I have just heard all the particulars. How could you  thus abuse my kindness, introduce yourself on purpose into my house to  betray me, and to play upon me such an abominable trick? Val .  Sir, since everything is known to you, I will neither deny what I  have done nor will I try to palliate it. Jac .  ( aside ). Oh! oh! Have I guessed the truth? Val .  I intended to speak to you about it, and I was watching for a  favourable opportunity; but, as this is no longer possible, I beg of  you not to be angry, and to hear my motives. Har .  And what fine motives can you possibly give me, infamous thief? Val .  Ah! Sir, I do not deserve these names. I am guilty towards you,  it is true; but, after all, my fault is pardonable. Har .  How pardonable? A premeditated trick, and such an assassination  as this! Val .  I beseech you not to be so angry with me. When you have heard all  I have to say, you will see that the harm is not so great as you make  it out to be. Har .  The harm not so great as I make it out to be! What! my heart's  blood, scoundrel! Val .  Your blood, Sir, has not fallen into bad hands. My rank is high  enough not to disgrace it, and there is nothing in all this for which  reparation cannot be made. Har .  It is, indeed, my intention that you should restore what you have  taken from me. Val .  Your honour, Sir, shall be fully satisfied. Har .  Honour is not the question in all this. But tell me what made you  commit such a deed? Val .  Alas! do you ask it? Har .  Yes, I should rather think that I do. Val .  A god, Sir, who carries with him his excuses for all he makes  people do: Love. Har . Love? Val . Yes. Har .  Fine love that! fine love, indeed! the love of my gold! Val .  No, Sir, it is not your wealth that has tempted me, it is not  that which has dazzled me; and I swear never to pretend to any of your  possessions, provided you leave me what I have. Har .  In the name of all the devils, no, I shall not leave it to you.  But did anyone ever meet with such villainy! He wishes to keep what he  has robbed me of! Val . Do you call that a robbery? Har .  If I call that a robbery? A treasure like that! Val .  I readily acknowledge that it is a treasure, and the most  precious one you have. But it will not be losing it to leave it to me.  I ask you on my knees to leave in my possession this treasure so full  of charms; and if you do right, you will grant it to me. Har .  I will do nothing of the kind. What in the world are you driving  at? Val .  We have pledged our faith to each other, and have taken an oath  never to forsake one another. Har .  The oath is admirable, and the promise strange enough! Val .  Yes, we are engaged to each other for ever. Har .  I know pretty well how to disengage you, I assure you of that. Val .  Nothing but death can separate us. Har .  You must be devilishly bewitched by my money. Val .  I have told you already, Sir, that it is not self-interest which  has prompted me to what I have done. It was not that which prompted my  heart; a nobler motive inspired me. Har .  We shall hear presently that it is out of Christian charity that  he covets my money! But I will put a stop to all this, and justice,  impudent rascal, will soon give me satisfaction. Val .  You will do as you please, and I am ready to suffer all the  violence you care to inflict upon me, but I beg of you to believe, at  least, that if there is any harm done, I am the only one guilty, and  that your daughter has done nothing wrong in all this. Har .  I should think not! It would be strange, indeed, if my daughter  had a share in this crime. But I will have that treasure back again,  and you must confess to what place you have carried it off. 6 Val .  I have not carried it off, and it is still in your house. Har . ( aside ). O my beloved casket!  ( To Valère ) My  treasure has not left my house? Val . No, Sir. Har .  Well, then, tell me, have you taken any liberties with…? Val .  Ah! Sir, you wrong us both; the flame with which I burn is too  pure, too full of respect. Har .  ( aside ). He burns for my casket! Val .  I had rather die than show the least offensive thought: I found  too much modesty and too much purity for that. Har . ( aside ). My cash-box modest! Val .  All my desires were limited to the pleasures of sight, and  nothing criminal has profaned the passion those fair eyes have  inspired me with. Har . ( aside ).  The fair eyes of my cash-box! He speaks of it as  a lover does of his mistress. Val .  Dame Claude knows the whole truth, and she can bear witness to  it. Har .  Hallo! my servant is an accomplice in this affair? Val .  Yes, Sir, she was a witness to our engagement; and it was after  being sure of the innocence of my love that she helped me to persuade  your daughter to engage herself to me. Har . Ah!  ( Aside ) Has the fear of justice made him lose his  senses? ( To Valère )  What rubbish are you talking about my  daughter? Val .  I say, Sir, that I found it most difficult to make her modesty  consent to what my love asked of her. Har .  The modesty of whom? Val .  Of your daughter; and it was only yesterday that she could make  up her mind to sign our mutual promise of marriage. Har .  My daughter has signed a promise of marriage? Val .  Yes, Sir, and I have also signed. Har .  O heavens! another misfortune! Jac .  ( to the Officer ).  Write, Sir, write. Har . Aggravation of misery!  Excess of despair! ( To the Officer )  Sir, discharge your duty, and draw me up an indictment against him as  a thief and a suborner. Jac .  As a thief and a suborner. Val .  These are names which I do not deserve, and when you know who I  am … SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE,  VALÈRE, FROSINE, MASTER JACQUES, THE POLICE OFFICER. Har .  Ah! guilty daughter! unworthy of a father like me! is it thus  that you put into practice the lessons I have given you? You give your  love to an infamous thief, and engage yourself to him without my  consent! But you shall both be disappointed.  ( To Élise ) Four  strong walls will answer for your conduct in the future; ( to Valère )  and good gallows, impudent thief, shall do me justice for your  audacity. Val .  Your anger will be no judge in this affair, and I shall at least  have a hearing before I am condemned. Har .  I was wrong to say gallows; you shall be broken alive on the  wheel. Eli .  ( kneeling to her father ). Ah! my father, be more merciful,  I beseech you, and do not let your paternal authority drive matters to  extremes. Do not suffer yourself to be carried away by the first  outburst of your anger, but give yourself time to consider what you  do. Take the trouble of inquiring about him whose conduct has offended  you. He is not what you imagine, and you will think it less strange  that I should have given myself to him, when you know that without him  you would long ago have lost me for ever. Yes, father, it is he who  saved me from the great danger I ran in the waters, and to whom you  owe the life of that very daughter who … Har .  All this is nothing; and it would have been much better for me if  he had suffered you to be drowned rather than do what he has done. Eli .  My father, I beseech you, in the name of paternal love, grant  me … Har .  No, no. I will hear nothing, and justice must have its course. Jac . ( aside ).  You shall pay me for the blows you gave me. Fro .  What a perplexing state of affairs! SCENE V.——ANSELME, HARPAGON, ÉLISE,  MARIANNE, FROSINE, VALÈRE, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES. Ans .  What can have happened, Mr. Harpagon? You are quite upset. Har .  Ah, Mr. Anselme, you see in me the most unfortunate of men; and  you can never imagine what vexation and disorder is connected with the  contract you have come to sign! I am attacked in my property; I am  attacked in my honour; and you see there a scoundrel and a wretch who  has violated the most sacred rights, who has introduced himself into  my house as a servant in order to steal my money, and seduce my  daughter. Val .  Who ever thought of your money about which you rave? Har .  Yes; they have given each other a promise of marriage. This  insult concerns you, Mr. Anselme; and it is you who ought to be  plaintiff against him, and who at your own expense ought to prosecute  him to the utmost, in order to be revenged. Ans .  It is not my intention to force anybody to marry me, and to lay  claim to a heart which has already bestowed itself; but as far as your  interests are concerned, I am ready to espouse them as if they were my  own. Har .  This is the gentleman, an honest commissary, who has promised  that he will omit nothing of what concerns the duties of his office.  ( To the Officer , showing Valère ) Charge him, Sir, as he  ought to be, and make matters very criminal. Val .  I do not see what crime they can make of my passion for your  daughter, nor the punishment you think I ought to be condemned to for  our engagement; when it is known who I am … Har .  I don't care a pin for all those stories, and the world is full,  nowadays, of those pretenders to nobility, of those impostors, who  take advantage of their obscurity and deck themselves out insolently  with the first illustrious name that comes into their head. Val .  Know that I am too upright to adorn myself with a name which is  not mine, and that all Naples can bear testimony to my birth! Ans .  Softly! Take care of what you are about to say. You speak before  a man to whom all Naples is known, and who can soon see if your story  is true. Val . ( proudly putting on his hat ).  I am not the man to fear  anything; and if all Naples is known to you, you know who was Don  Thomas d'Alburci. Ans .  Certainly; I know who he is, and few people know him better than  I do. Har .  I care neither for Don Thomas nor Don Martin. ( Seeing two  candles burning, he blows one out .) Ans .  Have patience and let him speak; we shall soon know what he has  to say of him. Val .  That it is to him that I owe my birth. Ans . To him? Val . Yes. Ans .  Nonsense; you are laughing. Try and make out a more likely story,  and don't pretend to shelter yourself under such a piece of imposture. Val .  Consider your words better before you speak; it is no imposture,  and I say nothing here that I cannot prove. Ans .  What! You dare to call yourself the son of Don Thomas d'Alburci? Val .  Yes, I dare to do so; and I am ready to maintain the truth  against anyone, who ever he may be. Ans .  This audacity is marvellous. Learn to your confusion that it is  now at least sixteen years ago since the man of whom you speak died in  a shipwreck at sea with his wife and children, when he was trying to  save their lives from the cruel persecutions which accompanied the  troubles at Naples, and which caused the banishment of several noble  families. Val .  Yes; but learn to your confusion that his son, seven  years of age, was, with a servant, saved from the wreck by a Spanish  vessel, and that this son is he who now speaks to you. Learn that the  captain of that ship, touched with compassion at my misfortune, loved  me; that he had me brought up as his own son, and that the profession  of arms has been my occupation ever since I was fit for it; that  lately I heard that my father is not dead, as I thought he was; that,  passing this way to go and find him out, an accident, arranged by  heaven, brought to my sight the charming Élise; that the sight of her  made me a slave to her beauty, and that the violence of my love and  the harshness of her father made me take the resolution to come into  his house disguised as a servant, and to send some one else to look  after my parents. Ans .  But what other proofs have you besides your own words that all  this is not a fable based by you upon truth. Val .  What proofs? The captain of the Spanish vessel; a ruby seal which  belonged to my father; an agate bracelet which my mother put upon my  arm; and old Pedro, that servant who was saved with me from the wreck. Mar .  Alas! I can answer here for what you have said; that you do not  deceive us; and all you say clearly tells me that you are my brother. Val . You my sister! Mar .  Yes, my heart was touched as soon as you began to speak; and our  mother, who will be delighted at seeing you, often told me of the  misfortunes of our family. Heaven spared us also in that dreadful  wreck; but our life was spared at the cost of our liberty, for my  mother and myself were taken up by pirates from the wreck of our  vessel. After ten years of slavery a lucky event gave us back to  liberty, and we returned to Naples, where we found all our property  sold, and could hear no news of our father. We embarked for Genoa,  where my mother went to gather what remained of a family estate which  had been much disputed. Leaving her unjust relatives, she came here,  where she has lived but a weary life. Ans .  O heaven! how wonderful are thy doings, and how true it is that  it only belongs to thee to work miracles! Come to my arms, my  children, and share the joy of your happy father! Val .  You are our father? Mar .  It was for you that my mother wept? Ans .  Yes, my daughter; yes, my son; I am Don Thomas d'Alburci, whom  heaven saved from the waves, with all the money he had with him, and  who, after sixteen years, believing you all dead, was preparing, after  long journeys, to seek the consolations of a new family in marrying a  gentle and virtuous woman. The little security there was for my life  in Naples has made me abandon the idea of returning there, and having  found the means of selling what I had, I settled here under the name  of Anselme. I wished to forget the sorrows of a name associated with  so many and great troubles. Har . ( to Anselme ). He is your son? Ans . Yes. Har .  That being so, I make you responsible for the ten thousand crowns  that he has stolen from me. Ans .  He steal anything from you! Har . Yes. Val . Who said so? Har .  Master Jacques. Val .  ( to Master Jacques ). You say that? Jac .  You see that I am not saying anything. Har .  He certainly did. There is the officer who has received his  deposition. Val .  Can you really believe me capable of such a base action? Har .  Capable or not capable, I must find my money. SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, ANSELME, ÉLISE, MARIANNE,  CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, THE POLICE OFFICER,  MASTER JACQUES, LA FLÈCHE. Cle .  Do not grieve for your money, father, and accuse any one. I have  news of it, and I come here to tell you that if you consent to let me  marry Marianne, your money will be given back to you. Har . Where is it? Cle .  Do not trouble yourself about that. It is in a safe place, and I  answer for it; everything depends on your resolve. It is for you to  decide, and you have the choice either of losing Marianne or your  cash-box. Har .  Has nothing been taken out? Cle .  Nothing at all. Is it your intention to agree to this marriage,  and to join your consent to that of her mother, who leaves her at  liberty to do as she likes? Mar .  ( to Cléante ).  But you do not know that this consent is no  longer sufficient, and that heaven has given me back a brother  ( showing Valère ),  at the same time that it has given me back a  father ( showing Anselme );  and you have now to obtain me from him. Ans .  Heaven, my dear children, has not restored you to me that I might  oppose your wishes. Mr. Harpagon, you must be aware that the choice of  a young girl is more likely to fall upon the son than upon the father.  Come, now, do not force people to say to you what is unnecessary, and  consent, as I do, to this double marriage. Har .  In order for me to be well advised, I must see my casket. Cle .  You shall see it safe and sound. Har .  I have no money to give my children in marriage. Ans .  Never mind, I have some; do not let this trouble you. Har .  Do you take upon yourself to defray the expenses of these two  weddings? Ans .  Yes, I will take this responsibility upon myself. Are you  satisfied? Har .  Yes, provided you order me a new suit of clothes for the wedding. Ans .  Agreed! Let us go and enjoy the blessings this happy day brings  us. Off .  Stop, Sirs, stop; softly, if you please. Who is to pay me for my  writing? Har .  We have nothing to do with your writing. Off .  Indeed! and yet I do not pretend to have done it for nothing. Har .  ( showing Master Jacques ).  There is a fellow you can hang  in payment! Jac .  Alas! what is one to do? I receive a good cudgelling for telling  the truth, and now they would hang me for lying. Ans .  Mr. Harpagon, you must forgive him this piece of imposture. Har .  You will pay the officer then? Ans .  Let it be so. Let us go quickly, my children, to share our joy  with your mother! Har .

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™ Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of  computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It  exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations  from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the  assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will  remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future  generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see  Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification  number is 64-6221541.

Email contact links and up  to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website  and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread  public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND  DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state  visit www.gutenberg.org/donate . While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation  methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To  donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project  Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be  freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and  distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of  volunteer support. Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed  editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in  the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not  necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper  edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search  facility: www.gutenberg.org . This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.  \n",

Gummerus Oy, 1923 Credits : Tapio Riikonen *** START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NUORUUDEN RAKKAUTTA *** NUORUUDEN RAKKAUTTA Kirj. Frank Norris Suomentanut Irene Mendelin Jyväskylässä,  K. J. Gummerus Osakeyhtiö,  1923. I. Kamiinihyllyn yläpuolella olevan schwarzwaldilaiskellon käki oli  lyönyt yhdeksän, kun Victorine tuli ruokasaliin tuoden tullessaan  kahtia leikatun vesimeloonin, jonka hän pani herra Bessemerin lautasen  viereen. Sitten meni hän ulos portille noutamaan kokoonkäärityn  sunnuntai-aamun sanomalehden, jonka painomuste vielä oli kostea. Kun  hän tuli takaisin sisälle, soitti hän toisen kerran aamiaiselle. Perhe odotutti itseään. Hän meni silloin huoneen perälle  ulkonema-ikkunan luo ja jäi sinne tuokioksi seisomaan. Näköala oli  ihmeellinen, Bessemerit asuivat Washington-Street-ylänteellä, melkeinpä  kukkulalla, suuren talon kolmannessa kerroksessa. Urakoitsija oli  osoittanut hyvää aistia antaessaan keittiön ja ruokasalin vaihtaa  paikkaa, niin että jälkimmäinen oli pihalle päin. Näistä ikkunoista  näki suurena kaarena San Franciscon lahden ja rannikon Mount  Diablosta yli Oaklandin, Berkeleyn, Sauccliton ja Mount Tamalpaisin  aina Kultaiselle portille, linnoitukselle, merelle, niin, vieläpä —  kirkkaalla säällä — hiekkasärkille saakka. Victorine seisoi hetken ja katseli tätä veden ja maan valtavaa  näköalaa; sitten kääntyi hän kärsimättömästi äännähtäen. Sunnuntaisin ei talon tavallinen järjestys ollut voimassa, aamiainen  oli juhla, jota saattoi viettää milloin tahansa seitsemän ja puoli  kymmenen välillä. Victorinen paraillaan kaataessa jäävettä maljoihin,  tuli herra Bessemer itse ja kävi heti ruokaan käsiksi ajattelematta  vähääkään odottaa toisia. Hän oli pieni, pyöreä mies. Hän käytti patalakkia kaljun päälakensa  suojana, ja hänellä oli silmälasit sanomalehden lukemista varten. Hänen  ryppyiset, parrakkaat kasvonsa tuuheine, harmaine kulmakarvoineen  panivat hänet muistuttamaan vanhaa, kunnon gorillaa. Bessemer oli niitä miehiä, joilla ei näytä olevan mitään tekemistä  perheittensä kanssa. Ainoastaan juhlallisissa tilanteissa pääsivät  hänen isälliset vaistonsa voimaan. Pöydässä ei hän paljoa puhunut.  Vaikka hän sydämellisesti piti vanhemmasta tyttärestään, oli tämä  hänelle kuitenkin arvoituksellinen ja vieras olento. Ei ollut mitään  siltaa tyttären ja hänen harrastustensa välillä. Lapsia puhutteli hän  harvoin, paitsi silloin, kun heidän piti saada nuhteita. Poikaansa  Howardia, perheen tulevaa päämiestä, joka nyt oli kymmenvuotias ja  »kauhea lapsi», ei hän koskaan sanonut muuksi kuin »pojaksi». Hän oli hajamielinen, omiin ajatuksiinsa vaipunut vanha mies, ja  hänellä oli vain kaksi heikkoutta — homeopatia ja kellosepäntyö.  Hänellä oli kummallinen tapa puhua itsekseen ja ilmaista kaikki, mitä  hän ajatteli tai mihin hän ryhtyi, kuiskaavin huomautuksin. Näin  hän nyt siinä istuessaan kuiskaili: »Onko kello yhdeksän? Kello käy  vähän liian nopeaan. Olen kai minä vetänyt taskukelloni? En, olen sen  unhottanut! Hoo, vai on vesimeloonia aamusella? Missähän veitsi on?  Minä haluaisin hieman suolaa. Victorine on unohtanut lusikat. Ei,  tässähän lusikka onkin; veitsi vain puuttuu.» Hän oli jo syönyt meloonin, ja Victorine tarjosi hänelle paraillaan  kahvia, kun molemmat lapset tulivat sisään, töksähtivät paikoilleen ja  alkoivat rummuttaa pöytää veitsien varsilla. Perillinen, Howard, antautui niin kokonaan pallopeliinsä, että hänen  oli ihan mahdotonta olla hituistakaan kohtelias. Pitääkseen kiinni  persoonallisuudestaan asettui hän aina kapinoivalle kannalle vanhempaan  sisareensa nähden, joka niin paljon kuin mahdollista koetti täyttää  heidän kauan sitten kuolleen äitinsä paikkaa. Hänen valvontansa  alaisena täytyi Howardin joka aamu itse harjata kenkänsä ja muuttaa  paitaa kaksi kertaa viikossa. Hänpä myöskin oli kieltänyt poikaa  sisällä leikkimästä hammaslääkärin pojan kanssa. Hänen pieni sisarensa oli paljon mukautuvampi. Hän oli kasteessa  saanut nimekseen Albera, mutta kotona käytettiin hänestä Kadetti- tai  Detti-nimeä. Hänestä luontui varmaankin kaunis aika-ihmisenä. Nyt  oli hän toivottomassa murros-ajassa, kahdentoista ja viidentoista  välillä, pitkäsäärinen ja kömpelö kuin varsa. Hän kulki vielä  matalakorkoisissa kengissä. Kun hän sai luvan pukeutua ensimmäiseen  pieneen kureliiviinsä, asteli hän ylt’ympäri äänettömän ihastuneena.  Pienen kureliivin ote hänen hennon vyötäyksensä ympärillä oli kuin  ritarillisen rakastajan syleily ja täytti hänet unelmilla, jotka olivat  yhtä epäkypsät ja epävarmat kuin hänen oma hoikka pieni vartalonsakin. Kun Detti ja Howard olivat istuutuneet, oli vielä yksi tuoli vapaana —  pöydän päässä vastapäätä herra Bessemeriä. »Tuleeko teidän sisarenne — eikö neiti Travis tule jo syömään? Eikö  hän ole vielä noussut ylös?» kysyi Victorine Howardilta ja Detiltä ja  piti samalla huolta siitä, että hän sai kerma-astian siirretyksi niin  kauaksi, ettei Howard voinut siihen ylettyä. Hänelle ei milloinkaan  olisi voinut juolahtaa mieleen kysyä herra Bessemeriltä mitään, joka  koski hänen perhettään. »Kyllä, kyllä, nyt hän tulee heti», vastasivat molemmat lapset yhdestä  suusta. »Tuolla hän on», lisäsi Howard. Travis Bessemer tuli sisään. San Franciscossakin, jonka naiset  kaikki ovat enemmän tai vähemmän kauniita, täytyi Travista pitää  kaunottarena. Hän oli nuori, mutta miehen keskikokoa, melkein  karkearakenteinen, leveäharteinen, korkearintainen, pyöreä ja  lujakaulainen. Hän säteili terveyttä. Kun hän vain liikutti jalkaa,  vaikutti se huiman elinvoimaiselta, ja hänessä oli jotakin niin  puhdasta ja raikasta, että saattoi luulla hänen juuri tulleen  aallokkoja sukeltamasta tai rantaäyräältä kävelemästä. Tunsi että  hänessä oli ruumiillista ja henkistä voimaa. Hänellä oli täyteläiset  käsivarret, leveät ranteet ja luja sormien ote. Tukka oli niin vaalean  ruskeata, että se oli melkein keltainen. On ehkä parasta sanoa sitä  keltaiseksi — ei kullanväriseksi eikä keltaisen punaiseksi, vaan aivan  yksinkertaisesti rehellisen keltaiseksi. Hänen hipiänsä oli kirkkaan  valkoinen; ainoastaan sileät, vilpoiset posket olivat hurmaavan  punaiset. Leuka oli pyöreä ja hiukan etenevä. Merkillistä kyllä, oli  hänellä jotenkin pienet silmät. Ne olivat pienet, mutta tumman, niin  tumman ruskeat, ja sitten ne elivät ja säkenöivät aivan niinkuin olisi  hän juuri nauramaisillaan tai jo nauranut — kumpaako, oli ihan mahdoton  sanoa. Mutta iloisempaa näkyä ei voinut nähdä kuin nämä ruskeat,  loistavat pienet silmät, joiden loistoa vielä kohotti valkea hipiä ja  keltainen tukka. Hänestä sai sen vaikutuksen, että hän oli täysin normaali nuori tyttö;  hänessä ei ollut mitään sairaloista, ei jälkeäkään hermostuneisuudesta  eikä rasittumisesta eikä minkäänlaista säröä. Oli mahdotonta uskoa,  että hän voisi syventyä omaan olentoonsa. Oltiin pian selvillä  siitä, ettei hänen henkinen elämänsä ollut miettimistä ja sisäistä  tutkistelemusta. Traviksessa ei ollut mitään tolkutonta. Hänellä ei  ollut päähänpistoja, hän ei ollut oikullinen — alakuloinen toisena  päivänä, ilakoiva toisena. Hän ei ollut mitään muuta kuin kiltti ja  suloinen ja luonnollinen tyttö, ruumiillisesti ja sielullisesti terve,  kunnollinen, voimakas, täynnä itseluottamusta ja hyvänsuopuutta. Vaikka hän ei vielä ollut pukeutunutkaan kirkkopukuunsa, oli hän  aistikas aina tohveliensa kärkiin asti. Hänen paksu musta hameensa  kahisi värillistä silkkikappaa vasten, ja valkoinen mustajuovainen  puseroliivi oli natisevan jäykkä. Tiukasti ja korkealle kaulan ympäri  kiedottuna oli hänellä leveä valkoinen silkkinauha, samalla kun hän  vyönä — ja se oli hänen oma pieni nokkela keksintönsä, josta hän oli  hyvin ylpeä — käytti jättiläismäistä koiran-kaulahihnaa, parahultaista  Sankt-Bernhardilaiselle. Hän oli yhtä sirosti rikattu kuin kilpapurjehtija. Ei puuttunut  nuppineulaakaan; ei ollut ainoatakaan saumaa, joka ei laskeutunut  täsmälleen juuri niin kuin sen piti; joka kerta kun hän liikahti, tunsi  kuin aavistaen naisellista tuoksua, osaksi hajuveden, mutta osaksi ja  enin hänen hiustensa, kaulansa, käsivarsiensa, koko hänen viehättävän  olentonsa määräämätöntä, mutta sanomattoman lumoavaa tuoksua. Hän oli  yhdeksäntoistavuotias. Hän istuutui pöytään ja söi hyvällä ruokahalulla, vaikka hän jakoi  huomiotaan Howardin — joka oli niin hirveän epäkohtelias kuin hän  sunnuntai-aamuisin tapasi olla — ja isän lautasen välillä. Herra  Bessemer saattoi varsin hyvin mennä pöydästä saamatta palastakaan,  ellei hänen suuhunsa suorastaan pantu hedelmiä, kyljystä ja kahvia. »Isä», sanoi hän niin selvällä painolla, kuin olisi hän puhunut  kuurolle, »kahvi on kyynäspään vieressä, varo ettet kaada sitä kumoon.  Victorine, siirrä isän kuppi vähän kauemmaksi laidalta. Onko se kyllin  väkevää, isä?» »Mitä? No, niin — kyllä, kyllä», mumisi vanhus ja katseli epävarmasti  ympärilleen. »No, kahvi; kyllä, kiitos!» Ja hän tyhjensi kuppinsa  yhdellä kertaa tietämättä oikeastaan oliko se kahvia vai teetä.  »Luulenpa muuten, että haluan saada kakkua,» mumisi hän partaansa.  »Missä ovat kakut? No, tuollahan ne ovat. Tuoreet kakut eivät sovellu  vatsalleni. Minun pitäisi mieluummin syödä tavallista ranskanleipää.  Luulen, että syön liian paljon. Missä nyt on minun palstani lehdessä?  Minä en voi milloinkaan löytää palstaani. Hän kirjoittaa oivallisia  johtavia, tuo herra Eastman, puolueettomia, vallan ennakkoluulottomia  — ennakkoluulottomia — ennakkoluulottomia.» Hän lopetti puheensa  epäselvästi kuiskaten. He jatkoivat aamiaistaan, jolloin Travis alati seurasi silmillään  kaikkea mitä tapahtui, ja samalla antoi Victorinelle päivällistä  koskevia määräyksiä. Hän teki sitä paraillaan, kun Detti alkoi huutaa:  »Anna olla!» »Ja sano sitten Maggielle», jatkoi Travis, »että hän pitää huolen  siitä, että tuo kanaviilokki ei saa liian paljon —» »A-a-anna oooolla!» vinkui Detti. »Ja pane sydän erilleen isän varalle. Hän saattaa sen hyvinkin tarvita  — — —» »A-a-anna oooolla!» »Puolueettomia ja ennakkoluulottomia», mumisi herra Bessemer,  »voimakkaita ja valtaavia. Tahdon vielä kakun!» »Isä, kiellä Howardia!» »Howard?» puuttui Travis asiaan. »Mikä on?» »Howard ampuu minua meloonin siemenillä», ulisi Detti, »eikä isä sano,  että hän ei saa.» »Ei, sitä en varmastikaan tehnyt!» selitti Howard. »Minä puristin vain  yhtä sormieni välissä tällä lailla, ja silloin se luiskahti itsestään  tiehensä.» »Viiden minuutin kuluttua menet minun kanssani ylös ja laitat itsesi  kuntoon pyhäkoulua varten», ilmoitti Travis. Howard tiesi, että sisaren päätös oli luja kuin persialainen laki,  ja hän laittautui valmiiksi määräajan kuluessa, vaikkakaan ei ilman  vastaväitteitä. Kohta nousi esirippu sunnuntai-aamun tavallista  näytelmää varten: Howardin pukeutuminen sunnuntaikouluun menoa  varten. Joka hetki kuultiin hänen kohottavan äänensä kimakkoihin  valitushuutoihin ja selityksiin. Ei, hänen kätensä olivat kyllin  puhtaat, eikä hän tiennyt minkätähden hänen piti käyttää tuollaista  punaista kaulusliinaa, joka oli kuin vanha rätti, ja voi — voi! hänen  uudet kenkänsä olivat aivan liian ahtaat, ja yhteen hänen varpaistaan  teki niin kipeää, eikä hän tahtonut, ei, hän ei tahtonut muuttaa  paitaa, ei, vaikka häneltä pää poikki pantaisiin. Mutta hänen ei  onnistunut hetkeksikään suututtaa Travista. »Hyvä on», tyytyi Travis  lopulta selittämään, »ensi kerran kun minä näen Minersin pikku tytön,  kerron minä sinun sanoneen, että hän on sinun morsiamesi. Tahdotko nyt  seistä hiljaa, kun minä harjaan hiuksesi?» Pari minuuttia ennen yhtätoista menivät Travis ja hänen isänsä  kirkkoon. He olivat episkopaleja ja olivat ikimuistoisista ajoista  vuokranneet puoli penkkiä heidän seurakuntansa omistamasta kirkosta  Kalifornia-streetin varrella, ei kaukana kiinalaisesta kaupungista.  Sitten kokoontui perhe taas päivällispöytään, jolloin herra  Bessemer söi kanansydämen — sittenkun Travis kolmasti oli häntä  siitä muistuttanut — ja esitti saarnaa ja papin teologiaa koskevia  huomautuksia puhuen milloin tyttärelleen, milloin itselleen. Päivällisen jälkeen olivat Howard ja Detti taas yhdessä lastenkamarissa  tavaliisine leikkikaluineen. Travis meni huoneeseensa kirjoittamaan  kirjeitä ja herra Bessemer istuutui ruokasalin ulkonema-ikkunan ääreen  lukeakseen vielä kerran perusteellisesti sanomalehden. Viiden ajoissa lähti Travis huoneestaan. Oli Victorinen vapaa-ilta.  Travis kattoi pöydän valkoisin korko-ompeluksin somistetulla  jaava-liinalla, jonka pohjalta mitä loistavimmin erottautui hopeainen  kahvikalusto ja hienot hollantilaiset kupit, joista hän oli niin  ylpeä. Sitten sitoi hän esiliinan vyötäröilleen ja meni keittiöön  laittamaan mayonäsia perunasosetta varten, leikkaamaan liikkiöitä ja  auttamaan illallisen valmistamisessa keittäjätärtä, hyvin taitamatonta  irlantilaista tyttöä, joka oli pestattu vain kuukaudeksi, siksi aikaa  kun koko perheen rakastama ja kunnioittama Sing Wo oli poissa. Kello puoli kuusi joivat he teetä; ruokalista oli kerta kaikkiaan sama:  kylmää liikkiötä, perunasosetta, sianlihaa papujen kera, sokeroituja  hedelmiä ja sitten välttämätön jäävesi. Victorinen poissa-ollessa palveli Maggie pöydässä ja tunsi olevansa  hyvin tyytymätön sunnuntaihameessaan ja kovitetussa valkoisessa  esiliinassaan. Hän oli niin tilanteen valtaama, että hänen luonnollinen  kömpelyytensä tuli kerrassaan yliluonnolliseksi. Hän asetti  lautaset väärältä puolen ja ojentautui änkyttämällä anteeksipyynnön  sopimattomimmalla hetkellä. Hän pudotti lusikan. Hän läikytti  lattialle jäävettä. Hän käsitteli lautasia ja kuppeja äärimmäisellä  varovaisuudella juuri kuin ne olisivat olleet pommeja. Hän harjasi  leivänmuruset herrasväkensä polville eikä muruslapioon, ja kun hänen  vihdoin viimein oli onnistunut hermostuttaa tyyni Traviskin, katosi hän  käskyä noudattaen keittiöön huokaisten sanomattomasta helpotuksesta. Äkkiä rämähti sähkökellolaite, ja Howard virnisti Travikselle  paljonpuhuvasti. Detti hyppäsi ylös, ja työnsi tuolinsa paikoilleen  huudahtaen: »Minä kyllä avaan! Kuuletteko?» Herra Bessemer tuijotti levottomasti Travikseen. »Herra Rivers kai tulee. Etkö luule?» Travis hymyili. »No niin, on kai sitten parasta — tarkoitan — —» Hän vaikeni äkkiä. »Ei, miksikä niin?» sanoi Travis. »Ole sinä vain siinä, missä olet,  isä. Sehän olisi aivan turhaa!» Vanhus istuutui tottelevaisesti takaisin paikalleen. »Hyvä on, Maggie», sanoi Travis, kun keittäjä riensi esiin. »Mutta Detti meni jo avaamaan.» »Ooh!» huudahti Howard ja virnisteli vielä leveämmin. »Ooh!» »Painappas mieleesi, Howard», sanoi Travis kylmäverisesti, »että sinä  et pyydä herra Riversiltä ainoatakaan äyriä säästölaatikkoosi!» Herra Bessemer hypähti ylös. »Onko poika ennen niin tehnyt?» kysyi hän kiivaasti kääntyen Travikseen. »Hän ei sitä enää tee», sanoi Travis tyynnyttäen. Isä katseli Howardia,  joka vääntelehti tuolillaan. Sillä välin oli Detti mennä kolistanut portille ja keskustelu katkesi  mainitun nuoren Riversin tullessa sisälle. II. Jostakin syystä, joka ei milloinkaan ollut tullut täysin selitetyksi,  olivat Condy Riversin vanhemmat jo kastemaljakon ääressä tasoittaneet  mahdollisuuksia hänelle ristimänimellä Condé, jonka anglosaksilaiset  kielet kuitenkin heti muunsivat Condyksi tai, lähimmän suvun ja  ystävien keskuudessa, vieläpä Connyksi. Kun häneltä kysyttiin missä  hän oli syntynyt — ei kukaan kalifornialainen edellytä, että hänen  naapurinsa on syntynyt valtiossa — tapasi Condy vastata, että  hän oli syntynyt Chicagossa. Hänen vanhempansa olivat muuttaneet  länteen vasta 80-luvulla, aivan parahiksi saadakseen isän haudatuksi  vieraaseen maahan. Condy oli ainoa lapsi. Hän oli käynyt valtion  yliopiston ja päättänyt opintonsa lueskelemalla vuoden Yalessa, ja  oli sitten pari kuukautta kotiintulonsa jälkeen saanut paikan San  Franciscossa Daily Times-lehden toimituksessa sunnuntailisälehden  aputoimittajana. Condyllä oli varmasti halua ja taipumusta kirjallisiin  töihin. Varsinkin piti hän »lyhyistä historioista» — hän oli alkanut  istuttamalla Kipling-bakteerioita, ja hän oli läpikäynyt melkein  hengenvaarallisen letkauksen Hardin Davis-kuumetta; niin, hänellä  oli myöskin ollut Maupassant-kohtaus. Hän oli tarkka yksityiskohtien  suhteen. Jos kirjoitti kertomuksen, jossa esiintyi palokuntalaisia,  niin piti tuntea tai ainakin piti näyttää siltä kuin tuntisi koko  palokunnan kuin viisi sormeaan, ja piti suorastaan »rakentaa  kertomuksia kaikellaisin teknillisin ilmaisumuodoin ja kääntein». Enimmäkseen oli hänen työnsä sunnuntain lisälehdessä päiväläistyötä —  kirjoitelmia määrätystä aineesta, uutisia ja haastatteluja. Mutta noin  kerran kuukaudessa kirjoitti hän lyhyen kertomuksen, ja viime aikoina,  sen jälkeen kun hän oli alkanut toipua Maupassant-kohtauksesta ja olla  taas hiukan oma itsensä, olivat nämä kertomukset käyneet paremmiksi, ja  pari niistä oli painettu idänkin lehdissä. Hän ansaitsi 100 dollaria  kuukaudessa. Kun Detti avasi oven, harppasi Rivers kahdella askeleella  portaita ylös, pani keppinsä eteisessä olevaan porsliiniseen  sateenvarjosäiliöön, veti yhdellä otteella päällystakin yltään ja  riensi puhkuen ruokasaliin riisuen samalla hansikkaat kädestään. Hän oli 28-vuotias — lähes kymmenen vuotta Travista vanhempi  — pitkä ja jotenkin laiha, sileäksi ajettu ja vaaleanpunainen  kasvoiltaan, niinkuin hän juuri olisi perinpohjin hangannut, niitä  kylpypyyhinliinalla. Päinvastoin kuin useimmat kynäniekat pukeutui  hän niinkuin kuosi ja tapa vaati. Mutta Condy meni liiallisuuksiin.  Hänen kaulaliinansa olivat liian loistavat, hänen värilliset paitansa  liian suuriruutuiset, hänen liivinsä liioitteleva. Traviskin, joka  nousi istualtaan hänen äkkiä tullessa sisään, ajatteli mielessään,  että sunnuntaina muodosti vaaleanpunainen paita ja hehkuvan punainen  kaulaliina melkein anteeksiantamattoman yhdistelmän. Condy tarttui molemmin käsin hänen käsiinsä ja syöksyi sitten herra Bessemerin luo: »Olkaa niin hyvä ja istukaa — kaikella muotoa!» Hän haukkasi ilmaa.  »Minä tulen vallan liian myöhään. Te olette jo lopettaneet, niinkuin  näen. Syy on kelloni — tämän tolkuttoman kelloni — en voi ymmärtää  kuinka näin kävi. Olipa hyvä, että ette minua odottaneet.» Kun sitten hänen sairaloisesti valpas huomionsa keksi hämmästyksen  välähdyksen Traviksen katseessa ja hän samassa huomasi, ettei pöydässä  ollut vapaata tuolia, pääsi häneltä pieni epätoivon huokaus. »Sinä lempeä taivas! Eivätkö ne ollenkaan olekaan minua odottanee ?  oli hän valmis huudahtamaan. »Olin kuulevinani, te sanoitte — minä  luulin — kuvittelin mielessäni — olen jollain tavalla käsittänyt  väärin. Se oli hirveä erehdys, sellainen tyhmyys! Mikä hutilus minä  olenkaan!» Hän vaipui seinän vieressä olevalle tuolille ja pyyhki otsaansa  siniraitaisella nenäliinalla. »Ei se tee mitään, Condy», sanoi Travis levollisesti. »Minä panen uuden  lautasen.» »Ei, ei!» huudahti hän hypähtäen ylös. »Ei tule kysymykseenkään;  sitä en voi sallia! Te voisitte luulla, että se oli harkittua minun  puoleltani.» Travis ei ollut milläänkään, teki hänelle tilaa vastapäätä lapsia ja  antoi Maggien valmistaa enemmän suklaata. Sillä aikaa Condy vain moitti itseään. »Aina sopimattomasti — aina vain tuotan vaivaa, minne tulen. Aina tulen  liian myöhään.» Hän nousi ja istahti uudestaan, pani sääret ristiin toistensa yli ja  muutti taas heti asentoa, otti korukapineita kamiinihyllyltä ja katseli  niitä, aavistamatta, mitä hän katseli ja lopetti rikkomalla lasin  kellostaan asettaessaan sitä käkikellon mukaan. »No, kas!» huudahti hän äkkiä. »Mistä te olette saaneet tuon kellon?  Mistä ihmeestä te olette sen saaneet käsiinne? Sitä en ole koskaan  ennen nähnyt. Mistä se on tullut?» »Schwarzwaldilaiskelloko?» kysyi Travis ja tuijotti häneen. »Condy  Rivers, te olette ollut tässä huoneessa viimeisen puolentoista vuoden  kuluessa vähintäin kaksi kertaa viikossa, eikä muuta kelloa ole  riippunut seinällä kuin tämä.» Mutta Condy oli jo unohtanut kellon. »Eikö todellakaan? Eikö todellakaan?» mumisi hän hajamielisesti,  istuessaan taas pöytään. Herra Bessemer puhui itsekseen: »Se kello käy liian nopeasti. Minä  en saa sitä noudattamaan aikaa. Victorine on hukannut avaimen. Minun  täytyy vetää se ruuviavaimella. Luulen, että minun on otettava vähän  enemmän papuja. Maggie on pannut liian paljon pippuria. Minun on  hankittava uusi avain huomenna.» »Vai niin! Todellakin!» vastasi Condy Rivers hämillään. Hän tahtoi  mielellään olla kohtelias, mutta hänen oli mahdoton seurata herra  Bessemerin ajatuksen juoksua. »Ei hän teille puhu», huomautti Travis, alentamatta ääntään. »Tiedättehän millainen isä on. Hän ei kuule sanaakaan mitä te sanotte. Minä olen muuten lukenut teidän novellinen tänään Timesissä .» Pari minuuttia myöhemmin, jolloin Travis ja Condy vielä puhuivat  novellista, nousi herra Bessemer. »Niin, herra Rivers», ilmoitti hän, »luulenpa että minä nyt haluan  sanoa hyvää yötä. Tule, Detti.» »Niin, ota hänet mukaasi, isä», sanoi Travis. »Muuten nukkuu hän tänne  sohvalle. Howard, osaatko sinä huomiset läksysi?» Niitä hän ei tietenkään osannut. Detti kerjäsi lupaa saada olla  ylhäällä vähän kauemmin, mutta suostui lopulta seuraamaan isäänsä. He  sanoivat kaikki kolme hyvää yötä Condylle ja vetäytyivät pois, Howard  hiukan viivähtäen kynnyksellä toivoen lanttia, jota hän ei tahtonut  pyytää. Maggie ilmestyi taas tyhjentämään pöytiä. »On varmaankin parasta, että siirrymme arkihuoneeseen», sanoi Travis  nousten. Arkihuone antoi pihalle ja rajoittui pitkään käytävään, joka kulki läpi  koko huoneuston ja josta ovet johtivat kaikkiaan kahdeksaan huoneeseen. Travis meni Condyn edellä ja sytytti sähkön messinkikruunussa, jonka  lamput olivat kuin himmeänväriset päärynät. Arkihuone ei ollut suuri, siinä asusti huonekaluperhe, jolla oli  valkoiset villapäällykset, sekä sohvilla että tuoleilla. Seinät eivät  olleet paperoidut, vaan maalatut. Yhdessä nurkassa oli käsinmaalatuista  vaaleanpunaisista kukista tehtyjä sinilaitaisia vihkoja, ja huoneen  toisessa sopessa oli hajasäärin seisovalla kullatulla jalustalla  lyijykynäpiirros esittäen Travista yhdeksänvuotiaana; se oli  »suurennettu valokuvasta». Puitteiden toisella kulmalla riippui  keltainen poimunne ja kamiinihyllyjä koristi alasriippuva sininen  nauha. Huoneen päävärinä oli valkoinen ja kulta. Piano, jota ei kukaan soittanut, oli jalustaa vastapäätä olevassa  nurkassa. Kamiinin yläpuolella riippui kullatuissa puitteissa  teräspiirros Priscilla ja Johan AIdenista, ja hyllyllä oli kaksi  terracotta-kuvapatsasta, jotka esittivät italialaista kalastajapoikaa  ja -tyttöä, ja punaiselle plyyssitarjottimelle oli asetettu tavattoman  suuri pöytäkello, joka ei koskaan käynyt. Kamiinin vasemmalla puolen  oli vihko preeriaheinää, ja oikealla puolella oli siniseksi maalattu  salaojitusputki, jossa oli tuhatkaunoköynnöksiä ja kimppu osmankäämiä;  sitä ympäröi vaaleanpunainen nauha. Travis vaipui valkoisella verhottuun sohvaan, ja Condy istahti  varovaisesti ohut- ja vääräjalkaiselle hataralle tuolille ja sitten  alkoivat he jutella. Hän oli ollut Condyn kanssa teatterissa viime maanantaina, kuten aina  maanantaisin sinä aikana, jolloin he oikein olivat seurustelleet  toistensa kanssa, ja tämä aine ei ollut vielä vallan tyhjennetty. Mutta  se ei riittänyt kymmentä minuuttia, ja sitten ei siitä enää ollut  mitään sanottavaa. Eräs nuori tyttö, heidän yhteisiä tuttaviaan, oli  nykyisin julkaissut kihlauksensa. Siihen aiheeseen tarttui Condy ja  piti keskustelua vireillä vielä kaksikymmentä minuuttia. Sitten täytti  hän uhkaavan -aukon kertomalla epähienosti seurapiirireporttereista,  miten nämä sieppaavat uutisiaan istuessaan päivät pääksytystenkin  kuuntelemassa puhelinkeskusteluja. Tällainen menettelytapa oli  Traviksesta ehdottomasti tuomittava; siihen sujui taas kymmenen  minuuttia. Näin saivat he kellon tulemaan yhdeksän. Sitten alkoi  olo kieltämättä käydä pitkäpiimäiseksi. Oli liian varhaista lähteä.  Condy ei voinut löytää sopivaa syytä, ja vaikka Travis oli kylläkin  hyväntahtoinen auttamaan häntä puolitiehen, meni keskustelu lukkoon,  ja ihan takalukkoon. Paussit kävivät yhä pitemmiksi. Condyssä heräsi  kauhea aavistus, että hän ikävystytti Travista. Aavistus hyytyi  silmänräpäyksessä varmuudeksi, ja silloin oli viimeinenkin jäännös  hänen raikkaasta reippaudestaan mennyt. Ja tilanteen teki vieläkin  pahemmaksi se, että hänelle juolahti mieleen, ettei hänelle viime  aikoina ilta illan jälkeen ollut käynyt paremmin. Sillä aikaa kun  tyttö taisteli pelastaakseen tilanteen, ajatteli Condy, olivatko  he mahdollisesti jo sanoneet kaiken sanottavansa toisilleen, oliko  molemmin puolinen vetovoima jo loppuun käytetty. Eikö hän nyt tuntenut  Travista sekä ulkonaisesti että sisällisesti, eikö hän jo tarkalleen  tiennyt kaikki mitä hän ajatteli, arveli ja uskoi? Eikö Travis jo  häneen nähden ollut menettänyt raikkauttaan. Tämä puolentoista  vuoden haihtuva mielistely oli ollut hurmaava — mutta oliko se nyt  ohi? Oliko leikki loppu, olivatko he leikkineet itsensä tyhjiksi? Se  oli mahdollisuus, jota hän ei koskaan ollut ajatellut, mutta siinä  hänen istuessaan ja katsellessaan Travista suoraan tämän pieniin  mustanruskeisiin silmiin selvisi hänelle äkkiä, että Traviskin ajatteli  samaa. Condy Rivers oli tavannut Traviksen eräissä tanssiaisissa ja  huomannut hänet tavattoman kauniiksi, niin teeskentelemättömäksi  ja niin luonnollisen hyväksi, että hän oli sopinut tapaamisesta  kolme neljä kertaa viikossa. He eivät olleet niinkään vähän yhdessä  olleet San Franciscon seuraelämässä, ja heidät laskettiin »nuoriin»  — vaikka Travis oikeastaan vielä oli liian nuori ollakseen mukana  ja Rivers liian vanha voidakseen tuntea itseään kotiutuneeksi  kahdeksantoistavuotiaiden tyttölasten ja kaksikymmenvuotiaiden poikien  seurassa. He olivat kohdanneet toisensa San Franciscossa käytännössä olevalla  tavalla. Huvikauden aikana kutsui Rivers hänet joka maanantai-ilta  teatteriin ja kävi säännöllisesti joka keskiviikko ja sunnuntai  vieraskäynnillä. Sitten tapasivat he toisensa tanssiaisissa ja pitivät  huolta siitä, että heitä yhdessä kutsuttiin teelle ja päivällisille.  He olivat liehitelleet varsin hurjasti, olipa Condy toisinaan yhtä  mieltä oman itsensä kanssa siitä, että hän rakasti tätä nuorta tyttöä,  joka oli häntä niin paljon nuorempi — tätä hymysilmäistä tyttölasta,  voimakkaine vartaloineen ja keltaisine hiuksineen, niin ujostelematon,  suorasukainen ja niin kerrassaan kuulumattoman kaunis kuin hän oli. Mutta nyt olivat he nähtävästi tulleet näytelmän viimeiseen näytökseen.  Ja kun Condy siinä istui ja mietti, ettei hän oikeastaan milloinkaan  ollut tuntenut oikeata Travista, että se tyttö, jonka hän niin  täydellisesti luuli tuntevansa, vain oli päivälliskutsuissa ja  teepöydän ääressä oleva Travis, yllätti hänet äkkiä levoton tunne,  ei, syvä ja aito suru. Hän ei oikeastaan koskaan ollut tullut tyttöä  lähelle. He olivat yhtä kaukana toisistaan kuin silloin kun he ensi  kerran tapasivat toisensa. Ja kuitenkin tunsi hän tyttöä tarpeeksi  tietääkseen, että se olisi maksanut vaivan. Hänellä oli ollut kylliksi  kokemuksia — useampia kuin olisi toivonut — toisten seuraelämään  kuuluvien naisten ja tyttöjen suhteen. Ne olivat rikkiviisaita, ne  olivat läpikäyneet koko huviasteikon — ne olivat, sanalla sanoen,  epäterveitä. Mutta Travis, tämä yhdeksäntoistavuotias tyttölapsi,  joka ei edes vielä ollut ensikertalainenkaan, hän oli terve ja  turmeltumaton, voimakas ja nuori. »Te voitte luonnollisesti nimittää sitä miten haluatte, mutta hän oli  kovin uupunut tai, puhuakseni suuni puhtaaksi, hän oli juovuksissa.» »Mitä? Mitä sanotte? Kuka? Mistä te puhutte?» Condy veti syvästi  henkeään ja istui äkkiä suorana kuin pilari. »Jack Carter», vastasi Travis, »ooh», lisäsi hän pudistaen avuttomasti  päätään, »hän ei ole kuullut sanaakaan. Minä puhuin Jack Carterista ja  eilisestä ’Lauantai-illasta’.» »Suokaa anteeksi, minä en todellakaan kuullut mitä te sanoitte. Elkää  olko pahoillanne. Minä ajattelin — jotakin vallan toista. Kuka oli  juovuksissa?» Travis oli hetkisen liikahtamatta, mutta sitten kiinnitti hän  niskakamman lujemmin. Ja sitten hän puhui. »Niin, jos te tahdotte vaivautua kuuntelemaan, niin minä kertaan  mitä sanoin; on nimittäin tosi kysymyksessä, ja minä aion asettua  hyvin jyrkälle kannalle siinä asiassa. Tiedättehän», jatkoi hän,  »mitä ’Lauantai-ilta’ on. Monet nuoret tytöt, jotka eivät vielä ole  seuraelämässä, ovat jäseniä siinä ja sinne tulee myöskin joukko  sellaisia, jotka alkoivat viime vuonna, ja muuten myöskin ne, joilla  on kolme neljä huvikautta takanaan. No niin, siellä on tapana tarjota  punssia; ja te olette itse nähnyt herroja, jotka ovat saaneet liiaksi.» »Totta on», myönsi Condy. »Tiedän, että niin on aina Carterin laita  ja molempain nuorten Catlinien.» »Siellä melutaankin joskus? Eikö totta?» »Kieltämättä. Se on rumaa. Mutta useimmat naiset — useimmat , sanon  minä — eivät näy sitä paheksuvan.» Neiti Bessemer jäykkeni hiukan. »On sentään pari naista, jotka pitävät sitä loukkaavana», vastasi  hän levollisesti. »Frank Catlin on siksi hyvin kasvatettu, että  hän vetäytyi pois eilen illalla», jatkoi hän, »eikä hänen veljensä  ollut tavallista pahempi, mutta Jack Carter oli varmasti juonut jo  varemmin. Hän oli kovin uupunut — niin kovin», sanoi hän vihaisella  äänenpainolla, »että hän hädin tuskin saattoi pysyä pystyssä. Olette  oikeassa siinä, että useimmat naiset eivät sitä pidä minään. ’Sehän  on vain Johnnie Carter’, sanovat he, ’mitäpä häneltä muuta voi  odottaa?’ Mutta Laurie Flagg — tunnettehan hänet — keskeytti tanssin  hänen kanssaan eilen illalla ja antoi hänen myöskin selvään tietää  minkätähden hän sen teki. Carter luonnollisesti aivan raivostui. Hän  oli kyllin selvä loukkaantuakseen. Ja mitä te luulette hänen sitten  tehneen?» »Mitä hän teki?» Condy kumartui henkeään pidättäen hänen puoleensa. »Hän kulki ympäri käytäviä ja pukuhuoneita ja levitteli hävyttömiä  valheita Lauriesta. Hän koetti aivan yksinkertaisesti» — hän pysähtyi  hiukan — »tehdä hänet mahdottomaksi.» Condy hyppäsi ylös tuolilta. »Sellainen peto, lurjus, sika!» huudahti  hän. »Minä en osannut odottaakaan», sanoi Travis, »että Carter uskaltaisi  pyytää minua tanssiin —» »Tekikö hän sen? Uskalsiko hän — — —» »Antakaa, kun kerron kaiken järjestyksessä», keskeytti Travis. »Se  tapahtui kotiljongin aikana; minä en sentähden ollut ollenkaan siihen  ennakolta valmistautunut. En aavistanut mitään, ennenkun hän seisoi  edessäni ja pyysi minulta galoppaadivalssin. Minulla ei ollut aikaa  ajatella. Tiesin vain että jos kieltäytyisin, saattaisi hän keksiä  minustakin jonkun ilkeän valheen. Minä aivan hämmennyin — en ollut  selvillä mitä tein. Minulla oli sellainen tunne, että edessäni oli  käärme, minun piti varoa, etten sitä ärsyttäisi, jos hänestä mielin  päästä eroon. Niin annoin hänelle valssin.» Condy istui sanatonna. Sitten nousi hän äkkiä. »No, niin, katsotaanpas», alkoi hän äkkiä ja pui nyrkkiä, niin että  nikamat natisivat. »Katsotaanpas. Jättäkää asia minun huostaani. Minä  tunnen Carterin. Hän tulee päivällisille, joihin minäkin olen huomenna  kutsuttu; silloin minä —» »Ei, Condy», sanoi Travis lempeästi, »sitä teidän ei suinkaan pidä.  Teidän ei pidä ryhtyä mihinkään, ja minäpä sanon minkätähden.  Olettakaapa, että te nyt asettaisitte kohtauksen Carterin kanssa — en  tiedä kuinka miehet sellaisessa tapauksessa käyttäytyvät. Niin, siiloin  puhuttaisiin joka klubissa ja sanomalehtitoimistossa, että kaksi  herrasmiestä oli joutunut riitaan erään nuoren naisen takia; ja minun  nimeni vedettäisiin esiin, siitä väitettäisiin ja sitä heitettäisiin  miesryhmästä toiseen, klubista toiseen, ja viimein se tulisi  sanomalehtiin. Sillävälin olisi herra Carter saanut asian kerrotuksi omalla tavallaan ja lisäämällä siihen uuden pienen valheen, ja  lopulta tulisi kaikki minun niskoilleni ja syykseni. Muistakaa Condy,  että minulla ei ole äitiä, johon turvautuisin, eipä edes vanhempaa  sisartakaan. Ei, meidän ei tule tehdä sille asialle mitään. Se on  sitäpaitsi arvokkaintakin. Minä olen vain omaan itseeni nähden tehnyt  päätöksen.» »Minkä sitten?» »Minä en enää mene sinne. Jos sellaista on seura-elämässä, niin minä»  — Travis veti sormenpäällään pienen viivan viereensä sohvaan — »olen  sieltä kerrassaan poissa. En sitä varten» — neiti Bessemer oikaisi taas  itsensä — »että minä pelkäisin Jack Carteria ja hänen matalamielistä  jaaritteluaan, vaan minä en aivan yksinkertaisesti halua seurustella  ihmisten kanssa, jotka suvaitsevat häntä seurassaan. Toiset nuoret  tytöt eivät pidä asiaa niin paheksuttavana, eivätkä monet miehetkään,  paitsi te, Condy. Minä en halua olla ihmisten kanssa, joista on  huvittavaa, että mies esiintyy juovuksissa seurassa. Ja mitä huviin  tulee, niin arvelen voivani keksiä muuta, josta minulla on huvia.  Minäpä alan pyöräillä ja tehdä pitkiä kävelymatkoja ja lukea yhtä ja  toista. Mutta elää seuraelämässä — ei! Vaikkapa se ei muodostuisikaan  niin hauskaksi, niin säilytän ainakin omanarvontuntoni. Minä en missään  tapauksessa halua enää tulla pakotetuksi tanssimaan juopuneen miehen  kanssa. Sellaista nöyryytystä en kärsi enää toista kertaa.» »Oletan sentään että on paikkoja, joihin te edelleenkin usein tulette»,  väitti Rivers. Hän pudisti päätään. »Olen punninnut kaikki ja olen myös puhunut asiasta isän kanssa. Ei  ole mitään keskitietä. Joko — tai. Olen juuri tänään kieltäytynyt  kolmesta kutsusta ensi viikolla ja aion pyytää eron ’Lauantai-illasta’.  Eikä se vain ole se Jack Carterin juttu!» huudahti hän. »Minä olen  väsynyt kaikkeen. Ymmärrättehän Condy», lopetti hän, »etten minä riko  tätä sentähden, että olisin löytänyt tämän tai tuon eiämänpäämäärän  tai muuta sentapaista. Minä aion kyllä huvitella, mutta minä teen sen  omalla tavallani. Jos hyvä tapa vaatii seurustelemaan Jack Carterin  kanssa, niin en minä välitä ’hyvästä tavasta’. Minä koetan tästä  lähtien olla oma itseni, niin hyvin kuin voin. Minä tahdon olla täysin  rehellinen enkä olla sietävinäni ihmisiä ja oloja, joita en voi sietää.  Minä tahdon tehdä sitä mihin minulla on halua — niin kauan kun on  jotakin, jota kunnollinen nuori tyttö voi tehdä. Ymmärrättekö, Condy?» »Te olette kelpo tyttö», sanoi Condy hiljaa. »Te olette kuin puhtain  kulta, Travis, ja minä — minä rakastan teitä vain sitä enemmän.» »No», sanoi Travis tehden äkkinäisen liikkeen, »on vielä toinenkin  asia, josta meidän on puhuttava. Me kaksi jätämme kaikki tyhmyydet  sikseen. Meillähän on ollut pieni oivallinen liehittely, ja se oli  kylläkin hauskaa niin kauan kun sitä kesti. Minä tiedän, että te varsin  hyvin voitte sietää minua, ja te tiedätte, että minä varsin hyvin  siedän teitä, mutta tiedättehän te, että me emme rakasta toisiamme.  Niin, sanottehan te, että te rakastatte minua ja että minä olen ainoa  maailmassa. Sekin kuuluu enemmän leikkiin. Minä osaan leikkiä» —  hänen pienet silmänsä alkoivat vilkkua — »yhtä hyvin kuin te. Mutta  me olemme leikkineet jollakin, joka on liian vakavaa leikiteltäväksi  — eikö teidänkin mielestänne ole niin? Se on epärehellistä, ja,  niinkuin sanoin, tästä lähtien tahdon olla niin rehellinen ja tosi ja  tunnollinen, kuin vain voin.» »Mutta kuulettehan, että minä rakastan teitä todella », väitti Condy  ja vaivautui sanomaan sen oikein vakuuttavasti. Travis antoi katseensa solua ympäri huonetta, niinkuin etsisi hän  neuvoa. Sitten hän huudahti: »Ah, mitä on minun tehtävä sellaiselle  pojalle! Sillä tehän olette todellisuudessa poika, joka vain on tullut  liian pitkäksi. Kuulkaa, Condy Rivers, katsokaa nyt minua suoraan  silmiin! Uskallatteko väittää, että te todella minua rakastatte. Te  tiedätte mitä minä tarkoitan, kun käytän sitä sanaa. Rakastatteko te  minua?» »En, sitä en tee!» huudahti hän, ihmeissään, kuin olisi hän tehnyt  havainnon. »Siinä näette!» sanoi Travis. »En minäkään rakasta teitä!» He purskahtivat molemmat nauramaan. »Onneksi meidän ei sitten tarvitse ponnistella näyttääksemme  rakastuneilta», lisäsi Travis. »Nyt ymmärrämme toisemme. Eikö totta?» »Tämä on hullua, tämä», sanoi Condy koomillisesti huokaisten. »Mutta eikö näin ole parempi?» Condy hieroi otsaansa. »Vastatkaa minulle suoraan», jatkoi Travis. »Nyt on teidän oltava  rehellinen.» »Niin, luulenpa, että on parempi näin. Kyllä — kyllä, helkkarissa! Travis, luulenpa, että pidän teistä nyt enemmän kuin koskaan ennen.» »Ei se tee mitään. Onko se etu vai ei?» »Mikä?» »Se ettemme enää ole rakastavinamme toisiamme.» »Kyllä, varmasti. Kyllä, te olette oikeassa. Samalla hetkellä kun  alan teitä rakastaa, tiedän nimittäin, etten minä voisi pitää teistä  likimainkaan niin paljon.» Travis ojensi kätensä. »Niinpä se siis on voitto.» Condy tarttui hänen käteensä. »Niin, se se on.» Mutta kun hän, tapansa  mukaan, aikoi suudella häntä kädelle, veti hän sen äkkiä pois. »Ei, jättäkää se tekemättä!» sanoi hän vakavasti, voimatta kuitenkaan  olla hymyilemättä. »Ei mitään tyhmyyksiä enää.» »Ooh, miksikä ei», valitti Condy. »Pitääkö teidän olla noin jyrkkä?  Ette suinkaan te tahdo lakkauttaa näin ikivanhoja ja kunnianarvoisia  tapoja. Tämähän on suoranainen kapina!» »Ei, teidän majesteettinne», siteerasi Travis ja koetti hymyillä, »tämä  on vallankumous.» III. Vaikka maanantai oikeastaan oli The Times’in sunnuntai-lisälehden  toimituksen vapaa päivä, aikoi Condy Rivers kuitenkin saapua  toimistoon hyvissä ajoin seuraavana aamuna. Erityisistä syistä oli  siellä kirjoitettava artikkeli, jossa oli kuvattava suuri hyljelaiva,  joka oli satamassa ja lastasi viljaa vietäväksi Indian nälänhädän  lievittämiseksi, ja Rivers halusi olla iltapäivän vapaana voidakseen  mennä teekutsuille Laurie Flaggin luo. Mutta kun hän tuli toimistohuoneeseen, joka hänellä oli yhteisenä  pörssi- ja urheiluosastosta huolehtivan aputoimittajan kanssa, ja  istahti pöytänsä ääreen, juolahti hänen mieleensä äkkiä, ettei hän  nykyoloissa voinut odottaa tapaavansa Travista Flaggin luona. »No, niin, niin», mumisi hän, »saattaapa olla samantekevä. Hän on  helkkarin ihastuttava tyttö, mutta — voinpa sen yhtä hyvin tunnustaa  — leikki on lopussa. Luonnollisesti en rakasta häntä hituistakaan  enemmän kuin hän minua. Olen tapaava hänet yhä harvemmin ja harvemmin.  Toisin ei voi olla, ja kun joku aika on kulunut, tunnemme tuskin  toisiamme. Tavallaan on se kyllä synti, mutta täytyyhän olla järjen  mukana tällaisissa asioissa… No niin, tuosta hylkeestähän minun  piti kirjoittaa!» Hän soitti kauppakamariin ja sai tietää, että City  of Ewerett, se oli laivan nimi, oli Missions-Steet’illâ. Tämä teki  hänelle mahdolliseksi kirjoittaa kuvauksensa kahdella tavalla. Hän  saattoi joko muodostaa otteen niistä asiaa koskevista painotuotteista,  joita pörssiosastosta huolehtiva toimittaja oli pannut esille hänen  varalleen, tai saattoi hän myöskin itse mennä paikalle, haastatella  kapteenia ja tutkia laivan omasta puolestaan. Ensimmäinen menettelytapa  oli helppo ja vaati vähän aikaa. Toinen oli vaivaloisempi, vaan  päättyisi paljon mieltäkiinnittävämpään kuvaukseen. Condy punnitsi asiaa pari minuuttia ja päätti sitten mennä laivalle.  Satama ei koskaan ollut ikävystyttävä, ja hän saattoi ehkä saada kuvan  hylkeenpyytäjästä. Äkkiä sukeltautui kirjoituksen aate ilmi hänelle,  tuo lisäksi ajateltava, joka oli antava muistiinpanoille ja kuvaukselle  merkitystä ja viehätystä. Hän oli heti tulessa ja liekissä. »Siinä se on», huudahti hän. Hän pani hatun päähänsä niin että ruusuke joutui väärälle puolelle,  pisti muistiinpanokirjan taskuunsa ja oli siinä tuokiossa jo uudestaan  kadulla. Sitten juolahti hänen mieleensä, että hän oli unohtanut  pistäytyä klubiin noutamaan aamupostiansa, niinkuin hänellä oli tapana  tehdä. Hän katsoi kelloaan. Vielä oli viljalti aikaa, ja klubin  huoneusto oli vain kahden katukulmauksen takana. Hän päätti ensin  noutaa kirjeensä ja sitten lukea ne satamaan mennessään. Condy oli liittynyt San Franciscon taiteilijain, sanomalehtimiesten,  soittajain ja oppineen väen klubiin, joka oli kaupungin vakinaisia  laitoksia ja todellakin kuulu kaikkialla unionissa. Hän oli sen  nuorimpia jäseniä, mutta kaikki tunsivat hänet ja pitivät hänestä, ja  hän oli useamman kerran tuntuvasti lisännyt klubin juhlallisuuksien  hauskuutta. Hän löysi omassa lokerossaan kirjeen, joka oli heti luettava. Kotelo  oli leimattu erään suuren new-yorkilaisen kustannusliikkeen nimellä,  jolle Condy kuukausi sitten oli lähettänyt novellikokoelman. Hän  meni klubin kadulle päin antavan pyöröikkunan luo ja repi ankaran  jännityksen vallassa kirjeen auki. Se että liike oli kirjoittanut  lähettämättä käsikirjoitusta takaisin, oli hyvä enne. Hän luki  seuraavat rivit: H. Condy Rivers, Bohême-klubi San Francisco, Cal. Palautamme kunnioittaen tässä postissa käsikirjoituksenne   novelleihinne, joita emme tällä hetkellä katso voivamme julkaista.   Mutta meidän on kuitenkin lisättävä, että olemme useissa niissä   huomanneet hyvin harvinaista lahjakkaisuutta. Mutta nykyään menee   parhaiten kaupaksi noin 30,000 sanaa sisältävä lyhyt romaani, jossa on   jännittävä toiminta. Esillä olevasta kokoelmasta päättäen oletamme,   että Teidän taipumuksenne johtaa siihen suuntaan, ja ehdotamme   kohteliaimmin Teille, että kirjoittaisitte sellaisen romaanin ja   lähettäisitte sen meille. Nöyrästi kunnioittaen Riemukustannusosakeyhtiö. New York. Condy pisti kirjeen taskuunsa ja vaipui masentuneena tuolille. »Mitä se hyödyttää? Turhaa vaivaa!» mumisi hän ja tuijotti apeana  kadulle. »Minä sovellun erinomaisesti rivityöhön paikalliseen  sunnuntailehteen, mutta houkkiomaista on minun ajatellakaan muuhun  ryhtymistä.» Hänen innostuksensa City of Ewerettiin oli kuin poispuhallettu. Se oli  aivan yksinkertaisesti ihan mahdoton aihe. Hänen äsken vielä loistava  »aatteensa» paljastui naurettavaksi, vanhaksi lauseeksi. Ei, hän menisi  virastoon ja kirjoittaa raapustaisi kokoon aiheen niistä leikkeleistä,  joita siellä oli. Mutta sitten huomasi hän äkkiä tutun olennon, joka hienosti  mustiinpuettuna seisoi vastapäätä olevassa kulmassa odottaen  raitiotievaunua. Se oli Travis Bessemer. Kukaan ei voinut niinkuin  hän pukeutua aistikkaasti ja samalla kuitenkin noudattaa ankarinta  yksinkertaisuutta: musta hame, musta venäläinen pusero, mustahuntuinen  musta englantilainen olkihattu ja valkoiset hansikkaat ja musta  napitus. Itse yksinkertaisuus. »Mutta niin tyylikäs», sanoi Condy  Rivers itselleen, »että siitä suorastaan häikäistyy.» Ja saattoiko  ajatellakaan mitään täydellisempää kuin tämä vartalo? Ja kuinka  kauniisti kuulsikaan hänen keltainen tukkansa harson läpi! Siinä oli  mitä lumoovin sopusointu. Ja komea ryhti ja pään heitto, ja — ei siinä  nyt mikään auttanut: Condyn täytyi mennä sinne juttelemaan hänen  kanssaan. »Mitä, mitä?» sanoi Travis, kun näytti siltä niinkuin Condy olisi  juossut suoraan häntä vastaan käytävällä. » Teidän tulee mieluummin  laittaa niin, että toimitatte jotakin! Kuljeksia kadulla kello 10  aamupäivällä, mitä se merkitsee?» »Ei kai se liene — ei, mahdotonta — ja kuitenkin - se on hän »,  lausuili Condy. »Niin monen vuoden viertyä.» Ja sitten rupesi hän  puhumaan luonnollisella tavallaan: »Kas, hyvää päivää T.B.» »Hyvää päivää, C.R.» »Minne te olette menossa?» »Kotiin. Minä olen vain ollut kaupungilla pikimältään saadakseni  banjoni korjatuksi.» »Jos saan luvan viedä teidät raitiovaunuun, odotatte kai, että minä  maksan konduktöörille?» »Herra Condy Rivers, olen aikoja sitten luopunut ollenkaan enää  toivomasta, että teillä milloinkaan olisi pikkurahoja.» »Ah, niin, ne menevät kaikki teatteripiletteihin ja kukkiin ja  konvehteihin eräälle tuttaviini kuuluvalle nuorelle naiselle. Mutta» —  hän heitti häneen tarkoittavan silmäyksen — »ei enempiä tyhmyyksiä nyt!» Travis nauroi. »Mitä teillä nyt aamusella on tehtävää, Condy?» He kävelivät Kearney-Streetille päin, kun hän esitti raportin. »Mutta minkä ihmeen tähden te ette sitten mene alas satamaan katsomaan  laivaa, kun se on ehto kunnollisen kirjoituksen saantiin?» »Joutavia, mitä hyötyä siitä on? Riemukustannusosakeyhtiö on hyljännyt  minun novellini.» Travis surkutteli häntä ystävällisesti. Sitten hän äkkiä huudahti: »Ei, teidän täytyy todellakin mennä alas satamaan! Kuuletteko Condy? Ja, tiedättekö mitä — ottakaa minut mukaan!» Se ajatus innostutti Condya: »Suurenmoista! Suurenmoista todellakin!  Mikä siinä olisi esteenä?» Ja tuskin puolituntia sen jälkeen kävelivät  he laiturien ja telakoiden välillä alhaalla satamassa. Siellä oli lukemattomia laivoja telakoiden loppumattomissa riveissä,  masto kohosi maston yli ja kokkapuu pisti esiin kokkapuun takaa, niin  että katse eksyi aivankuin lehdettömän metsän oksien paljouteen.  Kauempana sulautui tämä massa taklausten kanssa harmaaksi usvaksi  sinistä taivasta vasten. Valtavat laivarungot, vihreät, mustat ja  liuskakiven harmaat, laskeutuivat pitkin rantalaitureita ja ojensivat  hitaasti mahdottomia touvejaan. Niiden sivut aukenivat ja lasti  vieri, aivan niinkuin se olisi ollut sisuksia, ulos rantalaitureille  laatikkojen, vasujen ja paalujen hurjassa epäjärjestyksessä. Niiden  välillä kuhisivat kuin mitkäkin madot merimiehet, makasiiniväki ja  satamatyömiehet. Kokonaisia jonoja kuormavaunuja vieri esiin, raskas  kavioiden kapse rummutti lankkuja vasten. Rautakettingit kalisivat,  eräällä kajuuttaportaalla haukkui muuan laivakoira lakkaamatta, touvit  naksahtelivat, hihnat juoksivat ja väkipyörät kalisivat, rantapalkit  vonkuivat, ähkivät ja taipuivat kaareviksi. Kaikkialla oli touvien,  honkapuiden, maalivärin, maustimien ja kypsien hedelmien, puhtaiden,  raikkaiden rakennushirsien, kahvin, tervan ja pohjaveden hajua, samalla  kun kaikki oli hienon, raittiin merituulen kantamaa ja läpitunkemaa. Travis oli hurmaantunut. Hän katseli ympärilleen säteilevin silmin ja  hehkuvin poskin. Mikään ei jäänyt häneltä huomaamatta. Ajatelkaahan», hän melkein huusi, »kaikkia niitä paikkoja, joista nämä  laivat ovat tulleet! Ja katsokaa minkä nimisiä ne ovat. Eivätkö ne  ole kauniita? Kaikkia mitä nämä nimet kertovat: Mary Bake Mullista, Annandale Liverpoolista, Kaksi sisarta Calcuttasta, ja sitten tämä,  jota ne parhaillaan juuri tilkitsevät, Montevide Calloosta; ja tuo  tuolla, se on juuri se, jota me olemme etsimässä, City of Ewerett ,  San Francisco.» Se oli jättiläismäinen teräslevysilinteri, joka loikoi ja ahmi sisäänsä  San Joaguin-laakson vehnää, — toisen tuhannen tynnyrinalan sadon  toisensa jälkeen — kaikki aiottu ruuaksi ihmisille, jotka Himalayan  juurella kuljeskelivat kuin luurangot kummallisissa pukineissaan.  Travis ja Condy pujottautuivat veneiden ja vehnäsäkkien, höyryävien  vaunujen ja pyörivien rattaiden lomitse, ja pääsivät vihdoinkin  peräsillalle, jossa muuan merimies pysähdytti heidät. Condy näytti  sanomalehtikorttinsa. »Minä edustan The Times-lehteä», sanoi hän juhlallisella äänellä, »ja  haluaisin puhutella vartiossa olevaa upseeria.» Merimies antoi heidän heti mennä. »Sanomalehden voima», kuiskasi Condy Travikselle heidän mennessä  laivaan. Täällä tuli toinen merimies, joka vei heidät merkintäluukulla seisovan  perämiehen luo, joka, hullunkurista kyllä, paraillaan puhdisti  kitukasvuisen geraniumin lehtiä. Condy selitti asiansa huomauttaen samalla mairittelevasti  laivan uudenaikaisesta rakenteesta. Perämies — vanhanpuoleinen  patriarkkapartainen mies — sulatti sen silmänräpäyksessä ja kutsui  heidät sisälle omaan laivan peräpuolella olevaan kajuuttaansa, niin,  ottipa hän vielä esille telttatuolinkin Travikselle ja harjasi sen  puhtaaksi hihallaan, ennenkun hän työnsi sen esiin. Sillä välin kun Condy teki hänelle kysymyksiä, katseli Travis lapsen  uteliaisuudella kaikkea mitä kajuutassa oli. Lavitsaa, joka oli kuin  kidutuspenkki, pesupöytää, joka oli kekseliäästi laitettu niin, että  sen saattoi työntää seinän sisään, kun ei sitä tarvittu ja monia  valokuvia, jotka olivat soreasti pistetyt peiliin lasin ja puitteiden  väliin. Siellä oli varsinkin yksi, joka kiinnitti hänen huomiotaan,  vanha daguerreotyyppikuva, joka esitti hyvin kaunista nuorta tyttöä  korkkioran muotoisine kiharoineen ja niskajakauksineen, puolivuosisataa  sitten vallinneen muodin mukaan. Vanha perämies näki, kuinka tarkasti  hän sitä katseli, ja niin pian kun hän oli antanut Condylle tämän  pyytämät tiedot, kääntyi hän Travikseen ja kysyi päätään nyökäyttäen: »Hän oli kaunis, eikö totta?»’ »Hyvin, hyvin kaunis», vastasi Travis kääntämättä katsettaan kuvasta. Seurasi äänettömyys. Sitten sanoi perämies syvästi huokaisten ja katsellen miettiväisesti  eteensä: »Ja hän oli juuri teidän ikäisenne, neiti, kun minä näin hänet, ja te  muistutatte häntä.» Condy ja Travis pidättivät henkeään odotuksesta. Täällä tässä  naurettavan epämääräisessä kajuutassa oli äkkiä heidän edessään  romanttinen kertomus — joka oli sekä alkanut että loppunut ennen heidän  syntymistään. Sitten sanoi Travis hillitysti ja hiljaa: »Onko hän kuollut?» »Kyllä, neiti, hän oli kuollut ennenkun minä näin hänet. Toisin sanoen:  voipi olla että hän oli kuollut. Mutta sittenkin kuvittelin minä —,  niin, totta puhuen, niin uskon minä todellakin, että hän vielä elää ja  odottaa minua.» Hän vaikeni hämillään. »Muuten», jatkoi hän ja siveli  partaansa, »muuten en minä tapaa vieraille puhua tästä asiasta, mutta  te olette niin suuresti hänen näköisensä, että minä luulen, että teidän  täytyy saada kuulla tämä kertomus.» Condy istahti riippuverkon laidalle, ja perämies itse asettui  plyyssituoliin vastapäätä ovea, nojasi kyynäspäillään polviinsa ja  kiinnitti katseensa ulkopuolella kannella olevaan auringontäplään. »Minä aloitin sukeltajana», sanoi hän, »vieläpä jotakuinkin nuorena.  Olin vain poikanen, tuskin kaksikymmenvuotias, kun ensimmäisen kerran  ryömin sukeltajapukuun, mutta minä pystyin jo silloin nostamaan 70  leiviskää. Ensimmäisiä retkiäni oli matka Trincomaleehen Ceylonin  rannikolla. Muuan postilaiva oli uponnut pyörremyrskyssä koko  miehistöineen. Kuusi ruumista oli noussut pinnalle ja tuotu maihin,  mutta seitsemäs jäi mereen. Se oli saaren maaherran tytär — kaunis,  nuori yhdeksäntoistavuotias tyttö, josta kaikki ihmiset pitivät.  Lähettivät sanan minulle; minun piti sukeltaa meren pohjaan noutamaan  hänet sieltä. No, minä sukelsin. Laivan hylky oli 100 jalan syvyydessä  — se on jo koko syvyys. Minun täytyi sukeltaa sinne kahdesti.  Ensimmäisellä kerralla en voinut löytää mitään. Minä nousin taas ylös  pelastuslaivaan ja ilmoitin, etten ollut löytänyt mitään. Siellä oli  joukko väkeä pelastuskomppaniasta ja muutamia Lontoon sanomalehtien  kirjeenvaihtajia. He väittivät, että hän on siellä ja saivat minun  menemään alas toisen kerran. Ja tällä kertaa löysin hänet.» Perämies oli hetkisen vaiti. »Minun täytyy selittää teille», jatkoi  hän, »että kun joku ruumis ei tule ylös vedenpinnalle, jää se seisomaan  tai istumaan täysin luonnolliseen asentoon, kunnes ulkopuolella olevan  veden virtaus siihen koskettaa. Ja kun se tapahtuu — niin, silloin voi  luulla, että ruumis on elävä; ja vanhoilla sukeltajilla on sellainen  taikausko — ei, se ei ole taikauskoa, minä puolestani olen siitä  vakuutettu — että hukkuneet eivät kuole oikein, ennenkun ne tulevat  ylös, niin että ilma niihin koskettaa. Me arvelemme, että hukkuneet,  niin kauan kun he ovat siellä alhaalla viheriäisessä vedessä, yhä  ovat eläviä — eivät luonnollisestikaan samalla lailla kuin me, mutta  kuitenkin — tämän- tai tuonlaista elämää — jonkinlaista elämää heillä  on; se on aivan varma. Kun toisen kerran tulin alas, löysin oven; minä  luulin sen johtavan liinakaappiin. Mutta se johtikin pieneen hyttiin.  Minä avasin oven. Ja siellä hän oli. Hän istui sohvassa aivan oven  vieressä, hattu päässä ja käsilaukku helmassa, vallan kuin olisi hän  valmis astumaan maihin. Hänen silmänsä olivat aivan auki ja hän katsoi  minuun ja hymyili. Siinä ei ollut mitään kammottavaa ja kummitusmaista.  Hän oli oikein kauniin näköinen. Kun ovi aukeni, alkoi vesi liikehtiä,  hän nousi ja pudotti laukkunsa, mutta tuli hymyillen minua vastaan  ojennetuin käsin. »Minä vetäydyin äkkiä askeleen taapäin ja istahdin tuolille suuressa  kajuutassa toipuakseni hiukan. Se oli sentään hiukan kuin järkyttänyt  minua. Nyt minun olisi pitänyt ottaa hänet ylös. Mutta minä muutin  mieleni. Hän oli niin kaunis, juuri sellaisena. Mitä hyötyä siitä  olisi, että hänet otettaisiin ylös — tuonne pelastuslaivaan kaikkien  miesten joukkoon — ilma koskettaisi häntä, ja he panisivat hänet maahan  matojen luo. Täällä alhaalla säilyisi hän aina suloisena ja kauniina ja  olisi vain yhdeksäntoistavuotias; ja minä ajattelin, että olin kuullut  vanhojen sukeltajien kertovan, että hukkuneet eivät oikein kuole, kun  he vain saavat jäädä sinne alas. Minähän en ollut muuta kuin poika,  nähkääs, ja silloin on tällaisilla asioilla suuri vaikutusvoima. Minä  annoin siis heille merkin hinata minut ylös. He kysyivät, olinko nähnyt  jotakin, mutta minä vastasin, että en ollut nähnyt. Ja siihen se asia  jäi. He eivät koskaan saaneet laivaa ylös, ja pian olivat ihmiset  unhoittaneet koko tapahtuman. »Mutta minä en voinut sitä unohtaa. Minä kuljin aina häntä ajatellen,  näin hänet edessäni, sellaisena kuin hän istui siellä alhaalla  kirkkaassa, viheriäisessä vedessä pienessä hytissä ja odotti, että  minä tulisin takaisin ja aukaisisin oven hänelle, mutta hän ei ollut  muuttunut; hän on sama vielä tänä päivänä kuin silloin, kun hän  hymyillen ja ojennetuin käsin tuli minua vastaan. Hän on muuttumattoman  nuori ja terve ja kaunis. En ole nähnyt häntä kuin sen kerran. Mutta  minä sain hänen valokuvansa myöhemmin eräältä trincomaleelaiselta  naiselta, joka oli palvellut maaherran luona sisäkkönä. Oli miten oli,  vaan sen jälkeen en ole välittänyt muista naisista, ja siinä on syy,  minkätähden en koskaan ole mennyt naimisiin.» »Sen kyllä ymmärrän», huudahti Travis hillityllä äänellä, kun vanhus  vaikeni. »Sepä oli kaunista; oh, kuinka se olikaan kaunista!» mumisi Condy  haltioissaan. »No», sanoi perämies nousten seisaalleen ja hieroen polviaan, »nyt  olette kuulleet kertomuksen tuosta kuvasta. Haluatteko juoda lasin  madeiraa, neiti?» Hän otti esille aito Funchal-merkillä varustetun pullon ja täytti  kolme pientä lasia. Travis siirsi harson kasvoiltaan, ja hän ja Condy  nousivat seisomaan. » Hänen maljansa!» sanoi Travis vakavana. »Kiitos, neiti», sanoi perämies, ja he tyhjensivät ääneti lasinsa. Kun Travis ja Condy menivät alas porraslavaa myöten, tapasivat he  kapteenin menossa laivaan. »Vai niin, te olette olleet siellä ja puhuneet vanhan Mc Phersonin  kanssa», tervehti hän. »Saitteko haluamianne tietoja?» »Kyllä, kiitos, vieläpä enemmänkin», vastasi Condy. »Uskallanpa panna pääni pantiksi, että hän on teille kehrännyt lankaa  tytöstä, joka hukkui Trincomaleessa. Niin, luonnollisesti, tiesinhän  sen. Siinä asiassa on vanha poika kairaa vailla. Hän ei edes tahdo myöntää, että ruumiin aikojen kuluessa on täytynyt hajota. Oiva  merimies, ensiluokan merenkulkija, mutta siinä kohdassa aivoiltaan  pehmennyt.» IV. »Siinä vasta kertomus!» huudahti Condy, kun hän Traviksen kanssa astui  maihin. »Sepä vasta on kertomus! Ja se on sellainen, joka valtaa  mielen! Se satuttaa! Antaa hänen istua siellä, eikä sitten milloinkaan  välitä muista.» »Niin, se oli sitten kerrankin jotakin ihan uutta», yhtyi Travis yhtä  ihastuneena. »Mutta? Niin, se on suorastaan kuin taivaasta pudonnut! Se on —  tiedättekö mitä, Travis, siitä minä teen novellin, joka painetaan joka  ainoaan sanomalehteen Atlannin ja Tyynenmeren välillä.» Heidän ajatuksensa askaroivat niin perämiehen kertomuksessa, että he  unohtivat nousta raitiotievaunuun ja menivät jalkaisin Clay-Streetiä  pitkin, puhuen kilpaa, kuinka aihetta olisi käsiteltävä, kuvattava  ja koristettava, niin että se tulisi täyteen oikeuteensa. Condy tuli  iloisesti yllätetyksi nähdessään Traviksen käsittävän luonnoksen yhtä  nopeasti kuin hän itsekin ja että hän oli selvillä sekä siitä mitä oli  jätettävä pois että niistä ratkaisevista kohdista, joita piti korostaa. »Ja hylkeenpyytäjästä minä myöskin saan kirjoituksen, jota kelpaa  lukea», selitti Condy. Hänen »aatteensa» oli palannut ja sen kanssa  koko hänen työhalunsa. »Ja katsokaa nyt tätä», sanoi hän ja näytti hänelle  kustannusosakeyhtiön kirjeen. »Kirjaa ne eivät tahdo, mutta katsokaahan  vain kuinka ne kirjoittavat.» »Hyvin harvinainen kyky», huudahti Travis. »Mutta voitteko enempää  toivoa? Miksi ette antanut minun nähdä sitä ennemmin? Vieläpä  kerrassaan kehoitus kirjoittaa heille jännittävä novelli! Ja siihen te ette ole tyytyväinen? Mutta se on teidän tapaistanne», sanoi hän  harmistuneena. »Te kerrotte koko maailmalle vastoinkäymisiänne ja  mustaatte niissä itseänne, mutta ette hiisku sanaakaan, kun teille  käy hieman hyvin. Onko teillä luonnos tuollaiseen 30,000-sanaiseen  novelliin? Ettekö voisi siihen käyttää sukeltajakertomusta?» »En, siinä ei ole aihetta kyllin. Minulla ei ole aatteen säentäkään.  En ole koskaan kirjoittanut jännittävää novellia enkä milloinkaan  6,000-sanaista pitempää. Mutta voitte olla varma siitä, että olen  tähystävä siltä varalta, että jotakin ilmaantuisi. Muuten — missä me  nyt olemme, Travis?» He katsoivat äkkiä ympärilleen — vilkkaan satamaelämän raikkaus  oli kerrassaan kadonnut. He olivat pylväskäytävillä ja ulkonevilla  seinäsolilla varustettujen ahtaiden katujen ja kujien maailmassa.  Mitä kummallisimmat rakennukset, todellinen mehiläispesä ovineen ja  porraskäytävineen, melkein yhtyivät heidän yllään. Siellä täällä kohosi  huomattavan rikkaasti ja komeasti koristettu rakennus. Kaikkialla  oli värejä: vihreää ja keltaista, tulipunaista ja sinistä välähti  silmiin. Tuolla oli ovi, täällä vilahti pöyheä matto tai uudin, valtava  sinooberinpunainen kilpi kullattuine kirjaimineen, jalkaisin kulkija,  joka solui ohi, loistaen kuvakiikarin kaikissa väreissä. Kadun toisella  puolen, toisessa kerroksessa avautui murtunut harmaa sementtinen  pääsivu suureen loggiaan, joka hehkui punaisena ja keltaisena kuin  tulivuoren aukko. Suuria, kirjavia paperilyhtyjä riippui punaisina  ja keltaisina sen katosta ja pitkin kaidepuuta oli messinkisiä,  kuparisia ja sinisiä porsliinikukkaruukkuja ihan vieri vieressä täpösen  täynnä kaikkia mahdollisia vivahduksia olevia keltaisia ja punaisia  tulpaaneja. Kummallisia ääniä väreili ilmassa. Jossakin lähellä  olevassa näkymättömässä seinäsolassa ulvoi ja pauhasi rumpu, huilu ja  joku muu soitin kilpaa toistensa kanssa. Joka puolella kuuli ihmisten  tassuttavan tohveleissa ja juttelevan keskenään pienin, yksitavuisin,  nopeasti laulettavin sanoin, korkealta ylhäältä ja kaikkialta virtasi  santelipuun, käävän, suitsutuksen, öljyn ja salaperäisen ruokahajun  itämaalainen tuoksu. »Tämä on kiinalaiskaupunki», huudahti Travis. »Minulla ei ollut  aavistustakaan, että olimme tulleet näin kauaksi. Kuulkaa, Condy  Rivers, tiedättekö, paljonko kello on?» Hän osoitti hansikassormellaan  erään rohdoskaupan ovesta sisään, jossa muuan Seth Thomaan pyöreä kello  näytti puolta kolmea. »Teidän aamiaisenne!» huudahti Condy. »Taivas olkoon minulle  armollinen. Sen olen kokonaan unohtanut.» »On liian myöhäistä saada aamiaista enää kotona, mutta vähätpä siitä;  minä menen jonnekin juomaan kupillisen teetä.» »Miksi ette ostaisi pakettia kiinalaista teetä kotiin, kun kerran  olette täällä?» »Niin tai joisi sitä täällä.» »Missä?» »Jossakin täkäläisessä ravintolassa. Niissä ei varmastikaan ole  ainoatakaan sielua tähän aikaan päivästä. Tiedän että he tarjoavat  teetä milloin tahansa. Koettakaammepa sitä, Condy. Eikö se olisi  teidänkin mielestänne mukavaa?» Condy löi säärtään. »Mukavatako? No, siinä olette oikeassa. Sehän olisi  ihan paratiisillista. Odottakaa hiukan. Ja kuulkaapa kotvan. Tee ei  riitä. Me menemme Kaarney-Streetille tai torille ja ostamme muutamia  keksejä teen kanssa syödäksemme.» He riensivät takaisin California-torille, joka oli vain pari neliötä  kauempana ja ostivat pussin keksejä ja viipaleen tuoretta juustoa.  Heidän palatessaan takaisin kiinalaiskaupunkiin poikkesi Travis  Kearney-Streetin varrella olevaan musiikkikauppaan noutamaan banjonsa,  joka jo oli korjattu, ja näin kuormitettuina tulivat he takaisin  kiinalaiskaupunkiin. Condya hiukan hävetti kulkea voileipämytty kädessä  kadulla. »Koetetaanpa nyt löytää tuo ravintola», sanoi Travis, kun he  pyörähtivät Dupond-Streetille kiinalaistungoksessa ja kirjavapukuisten  lasten välissä. Heidän ei tarvinnut kauan hakea. »Täällä se on!» huudahti Condy äkkiä ja pysähtyi suuren  englantilaisella ja kiinalaisella nimikilvellä varustetun teetalon  eteen. »Olkaa hyvä ja astukaa sisään, Travis!» He nousivat leveitä messinkikaidepuilla varustettuja portaita ylimpään  kerrokseen, jossa ravintola sijaitsi. Siellä ei ollut ainoatakaan  ihmistä, niinkuin Travis oli edeltäpäin arvannut. Hän taputti iloisena  hansikoituja käsiään: »Suurenmoista; me saamme pitää tämän kaiken  yksinomaan itseämme varten!» Ravintola käsitti rakennuksen koko leveyden ja molemmilla sivuillaan  oli sillä seinäsola, toinen Dupont-Streetille ja toinen vanhaan  Plazaan. Taidokkaasti leikatut ja kullatut ebenholtsiset suuret  varjostimet värjättyine lasiruutuineen jakoivat pitkähkön huoneen  kolmeen pienempään, joista he valitsivat taaimmaisen, josta ovi johti  Plazaan päin olevaan seinäsolaan. Se oli viehättävä. Takanaan heillä oli tuo valtava fantastinen  varjostin, joka kohosi siinä niin ylpeänä ja ihanana  kultakirjauksineen. Edessään oli heillä korkeasta lasiovesta näköala  yli Plazan takana olevien rakennusten kattojen ja niiden takana olevan  sinisen poukaman, jossa laivat olivat ankkuroituina, niin, vieläpä  kauemmaksi aina usvaiseen purppurajuovaiseen Oaklandin rannikkoon.  Oven molemmin puolin oli syvissä komeroissa opiumipolttajia varten  suuret divaanit viltteineen ja patjoineen. Sinisillä seinillä riippui  kohtisuoraan punaisen ja hopean värisinä kiinalaisia sananlaskuja ja  pitkin salia oli pieniä mustapuisia pöytiä ja tuoleja, joihin kuhunkin  oli silailtu pieni, kirjava marmorilevy. Keskellä kattoa liihoitteli  kultakimalteinen kynttiläkruunu suuren pyöreän mahonkipöydän  yläpuolella. Eikä siellä ollut ainoatakaan sielua, joka olisi voinut heitä häiritä.  Syvällä heidän allaan vanhan Plazan takana kohisi laajana kaarena  uudenaikaisen suurkaupungin kiireinen liike, mutta se tuli niin kaukaa,  että se kuului rauhoittavalta, melkein unettavalta. Lähempänä mumisi  ja kuiskaili kiinalaiskaupunki itämaastaan. Ylhäältä meksikkolaisesta  neliöstä kajahtelivat tällöin tuomiokirkon kellot. Ei ollut ainoatakaan  pilvenhattaraa taivaalla tänä lämpöisenä iltapäivänä. Condy oli suorastaan hämillään ihastuksesta tästä, niinkuin hän sitä  nimitti, »löydöstään». Hän nousi seisaalleen ja istuutui uudestaan.  Hän meni ulos toiseen huoneeseen ja tuli heti takaisin. Hän veti kaksi  marmori-istuimista ebenholtsituolia pöydän luo. Hän otti hattunsa,  sytytti sikaarinsa ja antoi sen sammua, sytytti sen uudestaan ja  poltti sormensa. Hän aukaisi kaksoisoven ja sulki sen taas, siirsi  pöydän niin että valo lankesi sopivammin ja haalasi sitten Traviksen  ulos parvekkeelle näyttääkseen hänelle espanjalaisen torin ja sen  ympäristöjen historiallisesti mielenkiintoiset »paikat». »Katso, laiva tuolla Plazan keskellä on Stevensonin muistomerkki, ja  tuolla, missä lipputanko on, piti kenraali Baker muistopuheen Terrylle  — tiedättehän, hänelle, jonka Broderick tappoi kaksintaistelussa. Vai  oliko se Terry, joka tappoi Broderickin? Minä en voi sitä nyt muistaa.  Joka tapauksessa, tuolla suoraan edessäpäin oli mannermaalle menevän  postidiligenssin lähtöpaikka N:o 49:ssä. Ja kullankaivausaikana oli  pelipaikkoja joka talossa täältä torille käsin ja tässäkin. Ja katso,  tuolla kauempana on ruumishuone ja vankila.» He menivät sisään, ja suuri lihava kiinalainen tarjosi heille Condyn  tilaamaa teetä. Mutta paitsi teetä toi hän paahdettuja manteleita,  hillottuja melooninkuoria, sokeroituja hedelmäsydämiä ja kiinalaisia  pähkinöitä. Travis leikkasi juuston kuutioiksi Condyn kynäveitsellä ja asetti ne  geometrisiksi kuvioiksi keksille. »Mutta Condy, kuulkaahan», valitti hän, »miten ihmeessä te ostitte näin  paljon keksejä? Niitähän on yli sata, kokonaisen rykmentin tarpeeksi.  Minkätähden te ette kysynyt minulta?» »Mitä? Mitä te sanottekaan? Minä en ainakaan sitä tiedä. Mikä kekseissä  vikana? Me teimme paraillaan kauppaa juustolla, ja silloin kysyttiin  minulta montako keksiä halusin. Sitä en todellakaan tiennyt. Pyysin  hänen antamaan minulle neljännesdollarilla.» »Emmekä me voi mitenkään syödä enempää kuin kymmenen centin edestä. Ooh  Condy, te olette — niin, te olette — mutta olkoon sillään. Tässä on  teidän teenne. Haluaisin tietää maistuuko tuo viheriä piirakas hyvältä?» Kylläpä maistui; mutta se oli niin imelä, että heidän teensä  melkein tuntui katkeralta. Heidän länsimaisille kitalaelleen olivat  melooninkuoret mauttomia, mutta paahdetut mantelit olivat viehättäviä.  Sitten tuli Condy nielaisseeksi kulauksen teetä niin äkkiä, että hän  sai nikotuksen. Hän hyppi herkeämättä edestakaisin pitkin lattiata  kuin kananpoika ja piipitti, kunnes Travis tuli puolihulluksi ja  hervottomaksi naurusta. »Niin, niin», huusi Condy harmissaan, »naurakaa te vain! Minä en huomaa  tässä mitään hupaista. Ettekä varmasti tekään silloin, kun teille  itsellenne sellainen sattuu huik !» »Mutta istukaahan toki, mies, taivaan tähden! Te aivan hermostutatte  minut. Se ei noin teistä lähde. Teidän pitää istua hiljaa ja pidättää  henkeänne samalla kun laskette kymmeneen. Kuulkaa, Condy, luulenpa että  riisun harson ja hansikkaat. Luuletteko että se sopii?» »Tietysti, mitä sillä väliä? Sitten minä sytytän savukkeen. Onko teillä  mitään sitä vastaan, että tupakoin?» »Mitä teillä on tuolla?» »Täälläkö? En suinkaanhan vain ole — minä olen siis tupakoinut. Olen  tomppeli. Nyt heitän sen pois.» Travis tarttui häntä ranteeseen. »Lorua, Condy! Jos se olisi minua  vaivannut, niin olisin sen sanonut.» »Mutta sehän on loppuun palanut», huomasi hän. »Tarvitsen uuden.» Kun hän pisti kätensä taskuun ottaakseen savukekotelon, sai hän  käteensä sitomattoman kirjan, jonka hän otti esille ja katseli sitä  jotakuinkin hämillään. »Kuinka kirja on voinut joutua minun taskuuni?» puheli hän itsekseen  ja rypisteli otsaansa. »Minkätähden kuljetan tätä mukanani? Minä en  todellakaan muista siitä hituistakaan.» »Mikä kirja se on?» »Mitä? Mikä kirja?» Hän tuijotti häneen. Travis koputti pöytään. »Herätkää, Condy! Minä puhun teille», huusi hän. »Se on ’Elämän kilpajuoksu’», vastasi Condy yhteen hengenvetoon. »Jospa  vain voisin käsittää, mistä sen olen saanut.» »Mitä se käsittelee? En ole koskaan kuullut siitä puhuttavan», selitti Travis. »Ettekö ole koskaan kuullut puhuttavan ’Elämän kilpajuoksusta’?»  huudahti Condy. »Onko se todellakin täyttä totta? Istukaa nyt hiljaa,  niin minä luen jonkun kertomuksen teille, ja heti paikalla. Samantekevä  minkä. Minä avaan umpimähkään. Tässä meillä on muuan — ’Morrowbîe Juken  ihmeellinen ratsastus’. Se on teille näyttävä, mikä kirja tämä on.» Ja ensimmäisen kerran elämässään joutui Travis Bessemer, tässä  satumaisen kirjavassa kiinalaisessa ravintolassa, tässä kaupungissa  hänen lumoihinsa, tuon silmälaseja käyttävän pienen siirtolaisen, joka  täältä kiireimmittäin pakeni ja jonka laulua meidän täytyy kuunnella ja  jonka pillin mukaan meidän täytyy tanssia, kaikkien, haluammepa sitä  tai emme. Kertomuksessa Juken ihmeellisestä ratsastuksesta oli muuan kohta, jonka  havaitsemisesta Condy ylpeili. Hänen tietääkseen ei kukaan arvostelija  ollut siitä huomauttanut. Se oli se kohta, jossa Jukes kertoo elävien  kuolleiden kylän luona olevasta väijymäpaikasta, ja huomauttaa että  ympäröivien hiekkakasojen kaltevuudella oli »45 asteen kulma». Jukes  oli insinööri, ja Condysta oli oikea realismin loistonäyte kertoa  vuorten kaltevuudesta tätä teknillistä sanontatapaa käyttäen. Hän  aikoi ensin huomauttaa Travikselle, kuinka erinomainen kohta se oli,  mutta hän muutti lukiessaan äkkiä mieltä. Hän tahtoi nähdä, huomaisiko  Travis sen itse. Se olisi voimakoe hänen huomiokyvystään, sanoi hän  itselleen; melkein hieman suunnaton, kun ottaa huomioon, että ponsi  oli niin harkittu ja taitavankin lukijan ohi helposti luiskahtava. Hän  luki pysähtymättä edelleen, mutta kiihtyvällä jännityksellä sitä mukaa  kun hän läheni ratkaisevaa lausetta. Se tuli, ja hän luki sen panematta  siihen erityistä painoa, niin, pikemminkin melkein huolimattomasti  kiirehtien pelkästä pelosta, että hän muuten auttaisi häntä. Mutta kun  hän jatkoi edelleen, keskeytti Travis hänet, ja hänen pienet silmänsä  säkenöivät innosta ja tarkkaavaisuudesta. »Aivan niinkuin joku insinööri olisi sen kuvannut. Se on todellakin  hyvä!» »Hallelujah!» lauloi Condy ja hyväili haltioissaan kirjaa. »Te olette  ainoa laatuanne, Travis!» »Mitä te oikein tarkoitatte!» kysyi Travis hämmästyneenä. »En mitään, en ikinä mitään. Se on vain luonnonhistoriallinen  merkillisyys.» Ja antamatta muuta selitystä luki hän kertomuksen  loppuun. Sitten sytytti hän uuden savukkeen ja kaatoi itselleen vielä  kupin teetä, ja luki hänelle »Imrin kotiintulon» ja »Krisjna Mulvaneyn  ihmiseksi tulemisen». Pienen englantilaisen seurakunta voitti tytössä  äkkiä haltioituneen tunnustajan, ja Condy nautti voittoisan apostolin  iloa aukaistessaan tämän tähän asti tuntemattoman runouden maailman  hänen herkälle sielulleen. »Hän osaa!» huudahti Travis. »Se on jotakin parempaa kuin Maria Corelli  ja herttuatar.» »Ja ajatelkaahan kuinka paljon hyvää teillä on tallella! Te ette ole  lukenut mitään häneltä varemmin?» »En palastakaan. Minä en ole lukenut muita novelleja kuin niitä, joita  luemme opistossa.» »Nyt minä olen saanut siitä kyliäni!» mumisi Condy. Hänen mielialansa oli ollut yhäti nousemassa elämyksen jälkeen  hylkeenpyytäjälaivalla. Sataman hilpeä elämä, hänen iloiset mietteensä  siitä, miten hän kehittäisi perämiehen kertomusta, kiinalaiskaupunki,  heidän aamiaisensa viehättävä harvinaisuus tässä kiinalaisravintolassa,  säteilevä sää, ja sitten lopulta hänen ilonsa huomatessaan, kuinka  hyvin Travis ymmärsi hänen ihailemaansa ja rakastamaansa Kiplingiä,  kaikki tämä oli saanut hänet lehahtamaan. »Loistavan ohjelmamme seuraava numero», julisti hän, »on oleva  Banjosefine obligato a-sieas-duurissa, mainion impressaarion Conde  Tin-pani Riversin esittämänä tätä tilaisuutta varten erityisen  sopimuksen nojalla, pan-helleniläisen tanssin kera, jonka esittää  eriskummallinen lapsi miss Travis Bessemer, myöskin tunnette »Baby  Bessien» nimellä.» »Ettehän vain aio soittaa banjoa täällä?» sanoi Travis, kun Condy alkoi  avata käärettä. »Hiljaa parvekkeella!» huusi Condy ja ryhtyi panemaan soittokonetta  sopeihin. Sitten jäljitteli hän markkinailveilijäin ammattimaisen  yksitoikkoista kiirettä: Hyvät — naiset — ja — herrat. Teidän  — suosiollisella — luvallanne — olen — esittävä — uuden — ja  väärentämättömän — aito — Caroline-laulun», ja yhteen menoon jatkoi hän  hyrräävän hengästyneesti myötäillen: »Käytökseltään tyttöni mun on hieno,      väri heljä on ja nenän käyrä vieno.» Hän ei laulanut äänekkäästi, ja tuskinpa banjon hyrinä ja surina kuului  kauemmaksi kuin lähimpään huoneeseen; eikähän siellä ketään ollutkaan,  ja kun hän jatkoi, alkoi myöskin Travis hyräillä tekstiä. Silloin Condy  äkkiä taukosi, pani koneen ylenmäärin varovasti polvilleen ja sanoi  painolla: »Travis, te olette suloinen ja rakastettava tyttö, ja mitä teiltä  mahdollisesti kauneuteen nähden puuttuu, sen korvaa lämpöinen  sydämenne. Enkä minä myöskään epäile, että te olette vanhalle isällenne  hyvä; mutta — te — ette — osaa — laulaa.» Travis suuttui tästä avomielisestä lausunnosta, suuttui sitäkin  enemmän, koska hän tiesi, että Condy oli oikeassa. Hänen oli ollut  mahdoton laulaa enemmän kuin 5—6 tahtia eksymättä yhtä moneen  sävellajiin. Hänen äänensä ei itsessään ollut huono, mutta kun hän  uhalla jatkoi laulamistaan, taivutti Condy päänsä taapäin ja päästi  pitkäveteisen surkean koiranulvonnan. »Niin — niin — niin!» huusi hän ja tempasi banjon Condyn polvilta.  »Ellen osaa laulaa, niin osaan ainakin soittaa paljon paremmin kuin  vissit henkilöt, jotka kuvittelevat osaavansa kaikkea.» »Niin, nuottien mukaan!» härnäsi Condy, kun Travis soitti varsin  vaikean kappaleen. »Niinkuin kone — niinkuin ensiluokkainen  soittolaatikko.» »Hiljaa parvekkeella!» vastasi hän keskeyttämättä soittoaan. Sitten  lopetti hän komealla toitotuksella ja kääntyi voitonriemuisena Condyyn  päin. Tämä istui kuin syvään uneen vaipuneena. »Brrr-rr», kuorsasi hän. »Se on inhoittavaa, Condy. Minä vihaan teitä.» »Tiedänpä toisia», vastasi hän ylimielisesti. »Niin, olisittepa vain epäkohtelias.» »No! Mitä me nyt teemme?» sanoa tokasi Condy. »Jotakin on tehtävä. Lyömmekö rikki jotakin — vain huvin vuoksi?» Sitten muuttuivat hänen kasvonsa äkkiä tummaksi kuin ukkospilvi; hän  karkasi ylös, piteli ohimoitaan ja huokasi epätoivoisena: »Armias  taivas!» Travis aivan säikähti: »Condy», huusi hän, »mikä teidän on?» »Tee, tee!» valitti hän; »minunhan piti teelle Laurie Flaggin luo. Minun olisi pitänyt olla siellä nyt.» Travis huokasi helpotuksesta: »Siinäkö kaikki tyyni?» »Kaikki tyyni!» äyhkäisi Condy. »Vai sanotte te kaikki tyyni!  Kello on nyt yli neljän. Olin todellakin sen kokonaan unhottanut.»  Sitten hän äkkiä vallan tyyntyi ja istuutui taas hiljaisena. »No,  saattaapa se sitä paitsi olla kerrassaan samantekevä. Minä olen ihan  yksinkertaisesti menemättä. Olisiko teidän armonne niin ystävällinen  ja siirtäisi nuo mantelit hieman lähemmäksi minua? — Mutta mehän emme  toimita jumalan luotua sirua!» huudahti hän ja oli taas yhtä riehakas  kuin varemminkin. »Tehkäämme toki jotakin! Mihinkä me ryhtyisimme?  Keksikää jotakin! Emmekö voisi lyödä jotakin rikki?» Yhdellä  harppauksella oli hän pöydällä seisomassa ja lausui hurjin elein: »Ja kerranpa unssin[1] ma näin,      juoks peto tuo yrmyssä päin,      ja silläpä, nää,      kuin kissalla pää.      Nelijalkainen unssi, mi juoks,      — kas, se juoks,      nelijalkainen unssi, mi juoks. Niin pientäpä nimi on tuo,      mut joutuisitpa sen luo,      peto painoltaan      sata puntaa on vaan,      ja niin ilkeän sukkela myös      ja niin ilkeän sukkela myös.» [1] Ounce, vanha lääkepaino, unssi. Merkitsee myös pantteri. »Bravo! Bravo!» huusi Travis ja koputti pöytään. »Kuule! Kuule! — Ei ketään Brutusta, ei ketään.» Condy istahti pöydälle ja roikotti sääriään. Mutta seuraavan kahden  minuutin kuluessa heidän syödessään jälellä olevaa juustoa katosi  äkkiä hänen hyvätuulisuutensa. Hän huokasi ja hautasi synkkänä kädet  taskuihin. »Enemmänkö juustoa?» kysyi Travis. Hän pudisti päätään ja rypisti otsaansa. »Elkää puhuko minulle  juustosta!» »Miten on laitanne, Condy? Voitteko pahoin?» kysyi Travis huolestuneena. Hän ei tahtonut ensin sanoa sanaakaan; kaikkeen mitä Travis kysyi  vastasi hän vain sulkemalla silmänsä ja panemalla päänsä taapäin  samalla merkitsevästi nyökäyttäen. »Mitä se sitten on? Nyt on teidän todellakin sanottava se minulle!» »Te ette anna minulle mitään arvoa», mumisi hän. Ja kesti kauan,  ennenkuin hän halusi selittää asian. Ei, ei, Travis ei häntä  hituistakaan kunnioittanut; ei pitänyt hänestä lukua; ei, Travis ei  ottanut häntä vakavalta kannalta. »Niin, toden totta. Mitä te tarkoitatte? Mitä te nyt taas keksitte, Condy Rivers?» »Ah ei, tiedän sen varsin hyvin. Liiankin hyvin. Teette ota minua  vakavalta kannalta. Te ette pidä minusta lukua.» »Mitä aihetta olen antanut teille sellaiseen luuloon?» »Tehkää minut yhtä hurmaavasti teidän narriksenne», mumisi hän  traagillisesti. Travis kävi siitä todellakin pahoilleen ja väitti voimakkaasti häntä  vastaan. Mitä, hehän olivat vain huvitelleet; siinä kaikki. Ja hän oli  ollut aivan yhtä houkkiomainen kuin Condy. Condy iski sanaan kiinni. »Niin, houkkiomainen; siinä sitä ollaan. Tiesinhän sen. Minä olen  houkkiomainen. Narri, pajatso. — Mutta tänään meillä on ollut  suurenmoista, eikö totta?» lisäsi hän katkerasti virnistäen. »En tiedä että minulla koskaan olisi ollut parempaa päivää», selitti Travis korostaen sanojaan, »ja tiedänpä myöskin minkätähden?» »Minkätähden sitten?» »Sentähden että me emme ole tehneet mitään tyhmyyksiä. Me olemme  vain olleet omat itsemme, emmekä ole vaivautuneet teeskentelemään  rakastuneita. Jota emme olekaan. Näin teemme uudestaan, Condy, emmekö  teekin? Tuhat kertaa.» »Mitä?» »Kuljeskelemme ja löydämme tällaisia pieniä hauskoja paikkoja. Meillä  on ollut loistava päivä tänään, eikö teidänkin mielestänne? Emmekä ole  kertaakaan olleet pulassa siitä mitä meidän pitäisi sanoa.» »Niinkuin esim. eilen illalla», arvaili Condy. »Niin, arvelin kyllä että tekin sen huomaisitte. Se tuntui koko lailla  ilkeältä, vai kuinka?» »Kyllä.» »Tehdäänpä nyt päätös. Tiedän, että tekin olette siitä tänään iloinnut. Ettekö ole huvitellut paremmin kuin jos olisitte mennyt teekutsuille?» »Kyllä, luulenpa todellakin. Minulla ei koskaan ole ollut hauskempaa ja  parempaa päivää?» »Hyvä, koettakaamme siis järjestää näin tästä lähtien usein. Mutta vain  tovereina. Olemme kokeilleet sillä toisellakin, vaan se ei käynyt.  Olkaa nyt rehellinen: kävikö se?» »Säkene singahti siitä; niin se oli.» »No, siis tästä lähtien ei mitään tyhmyyksiä. Vain hyvää toveruutta.» »Hyvää toveruutta, niin. Ei mitään tyhmyyksiä enää.» »Samassa silmänräpäyksessä kun te olette olevinanne rakastunut  minuun, on kaikki mennyttä. Eikä ihmekään», sanoi Travis ja veti  hansikkaat käsiinsä. »Me kaksi olemme todellakin merkilliset,  Condy. Yhdeksällekymmenelleyhdeksälle sadasta olisi juttu loppunut  eileniltaiseen »selvittelyyn» — jolloin me tunnustimme, että emme  rakastaneet toisiamme. Useimmat olisivat menneet kukin taholleen; mutta  tässä me nyt olemme ja sovimme hyvästä toveruudesta ja jatkuvasti  huvitellaksemme omalla tavallamme, emmekä välitä hituistakaan tavasta  ja järjestyksestä. Ja me voimme toteuttaa sen. — Kas niin, nyt hän on  taas poissa. Onko hän kuullut sanaakaan puheestani? Condy, mitä te  ajattelette?» »Blix», mumisi hän ja tuijotti poissaolevasti tyttöön. »Blix — niin,  juuri siltä te näytätte. En tiedä, mutta jotakin sen tapaista kuin Blix  te olette näöltänne. Ettekö te itsekin tunne sitä olevanne», kysyi hän  innokkaasti. »Blix? Mitä te tarkoitatte?» Hän löi kämmenellään pöytään. »Oikein osattu!» sanoi hän. »Kuuleehan  sen ihan äänestä, valtoin ja ripeä, hieno ja helakka ja kajahteleva —  kas noin!» Hän näpäytti sormillaan. »Ettekö ymmärrä, mitä tarkoitan?  Blix, se olette te. Te olette aina ollut Blix, mutta minä olen nyt  vasta sen älynnyt. Blix» — hän kuulosti ääntä — »Blix — Blix. Niin, se  on selvää, teidän nimenne on Blix.» »Blix?» kertasi Travis. »Minkätähden pitää minun olla niineltäni Blix?» »Niin, miksipä ette olisi?» »Hyvä, sitten on asia selvä», selitti hän, niinkuin kysymys sillä  olisi ollut ratkaistu. Alkoi käydä myöhäiseksi, ja he valmistautuivat  menemään. »Sitokaa tämä minulle, Condy», pyysi hän ja käänsi niskansa Condyyn  päin pitäen harsonsa päistä kiinni. »Ei liian lujalle. Te sidotte liian  lujalle, Condy. Noin jotakuinkin. Elkää nyt vain unohtako tänne mitään  kapineistanne. Olen varma siitä, että te unohdatte jotakin. Olkaa hyvä,  tuossa on savukekotelonne ja kirja ja luonnollisesti banjo.» Niinkuin salaperäisen vaiston kutsumana näyttäytyi lihava kiinalainen  viereisessä huoneessa. Condy pisti kaksi sormea liivintaskuun ja vaipui  sitten takaisin tuolille huudahtaen tukahutetun kauhistuneesti. »Oletteko sairas, Condy?» kysyi Blix säikähtyneenä. Hän oli aivan  valkoinen kasvoiltaan. »Minulla ei ole senttiäkään mukanani», mumisi Condy heikosti. »Minun  viimeinen neljännesdollarini meni noihin inhottaviin kekseihin. Mitä  nyt on tehtävä? Minun on — minun on annettava hänelle kelloni. Niin, se  on ainoa keino.» Blix otti kylmäverisesti kukkaronsa esille. »Odotin sitä», sanoi hän alistuneena. »Odotin että niin kävisi ennemmin  tai myöhemmin, olen aina varonut sitä. Paljonko on, John», kysyi hän  kiinalaiselta. »Puol’ dollaria.» »En uskalla ikinä enää katsoa silmiinne», vaikeroi Condy. »Minä maksan  sen iltasella. Minä lähetän teille rahat pikalähetin myötä.» »Silloinpa käyttäytyisitte kuin narri.» »Ah», huokasi hän, »te nöyryytätte minua; te poljette minut tomuun.» »Tulkaa nyt, älkääkä olko hassu! Kello lienee yli viiden.» Ehdittyään kauniilla messinkikaiteella varustettujen portaiden  puoliväliin löi hän äkkiä otsaansa. »No, mikä nyt on?» kysyi Travis lempeästi. »Unhotin ne! Olen ne unhottanut!» huudahti hän. »Tiesin kyllä että  unhottaisin jotakin.» »Te tarkoitatte, että minä tiesin sen?» Hän riensi ylös, tuli takaisin suuri keksipussi mukanaan ja antoi sen Traviksen käteen. »Kas tässä, ottakaa ne nyt. Emmehän me voi antaa niiden jäädä tänne»,  selitti hän totisena. »Se olisi suunnatonta tuhlaamista.» Ja tytön  vastaväitteistä huolimatta pakotti hän tämän ottamaan keksit. »Ihmettelen», sanoi Blix heidän kulkiessaan pitkin toria Kearney-Streetille päin; »ihmettelen, kutsuisinko hänet illalliselle.» »Kenet? Minutko? Se oli vasta ihmeellinen…» »Ihmettelen keksimmekö jotakin puheenaihetta vielä. Muussa tapauksessa  tulisi tälle päivälle huono loppu.» »Minä syön joka tapauksessa klubissa, ja minä tahdon saada  kirjoitukseni valmiiksi tänä iltana.» Blix katseli häntä ilmeisesti huolestuneena. »Älkää pelatko tänä iltana, Condy!» sanoi hän äkkiä vakavasti. »Ei maksa vaivaa puhua minulle pelaamisesta. Eihän minulla ole rahoja  millä pelata?» »Mutta te voitte ehkä saada niitä. Luvatkaa nyt kuitenkin minulle olla  pelaamatta.» »Kyllä, minä lupaan. Sehän ei voi tulla kysymykseenkään, kun minulla  ei ole rahaa. Ja pitäähän minun sitä paitsi kirjoittaa tuosta  hylkeenpyytäjästä. Tänä iltana syön klubilla ja sitten istahdan  kirjastohuoneeseen ja olen mustekala.» »Kuulkaa, Condy», sanoi Blix, »tuo sukeltajakertomus on todellakin  liian hyvä Timesiin. Tehkääpä se oikein huolellisesti ja lähettäkää se  New York’ille. Niin, minkätähden ei? Lähettäisitte sen riemujulkaisuun.  Nyt ne ovat kiinnittäneet huomionsa teidän nimeenne, ja olisihan se  kuin alleviivaamista, jos te nyt lähettäisitte niille tuon kertomuksen,  vaikkapa sitä ei otettaisikaan. Ajatelkaa asiaa!» »Ajatus on hyvä. Minä kyllä sen teen. Minä olen vain pakoitettu  kirjoittamaan sen loma-aikanani. Siitä tulee ylityötä.» »Välipä sillä? Tehkää se kuitenkin. Ja», lisäsi hän samalla kun Condy auttoi häntä vaunuun, »älkää nyt vain unhoittako tuota kolmenkymmenentuhannen sanan pituista jännittävää romaania. Hyvästi, Condy. Ja kiitos tästä päivästä!» »Kiitos teille.» »Eikö meillä ole ollut erinomainen päivä?» »Meillä ei koskaan ole ollut parempaa. Hyvästi, Blix.» Condy meni  klubiinsa. Kello oli kuuden paikoilla. Hän ojensi vartialle hattunsa ja  kysyi oliko jollakin ollut hänelle asiaa. Kyllä, hra Sargeant oli ollut  siellä pari minuuttia sitten ja olisi halunnut puhua hänen kanssaan. Edellisenä lauantaina olivat Condy ja Tracy Sargeant sopineet syövänsä  iltasta yhdessä ja sen jälkeen mahdollisesti menevänsä teatteriin.  Kun Condy nyt näki Sargeantin istuvan salissa pyöreän pöydän ääressä  syventyneenä Gil Blasiin, ilostui hän siitä, ettei kumpikaan ollut  seuranpettäjä. Sargeant otti hänet ylen sydämellisesti vastaan ja ehdotti, että he  joisivat jotakin. Sargeant oli iloinen, hyvin kasvatettu ja kaunis  kolmenkymmenen paikoilla oleva veitikka. Vain silmien alla olevat  pienet pussit ja ohimoilla heikosti kohoutuvat suonet juorusivat, ettei  hän arvatenkaan viettänyt aivan mallikelpoista elämää. Hän käytti  vielä surupukua isänsä äkillisen kuoleman johdosta, joka oli tuottanut  hänelle kuukautisen koron, viisi kertaa niin suuren kuin Condyn  palkka. Kun he istuivat pöydässä, ehdotti Sargeant, että he menisivät  teatteriin. »En voi tulla; minulla on työtä tänä iltana», vakuutti Condy. . Kun he päivällisen jälkeen istuivat kahvia juoden ja sikaareja  poltellen salissa erään ikkunan luona, tuli palvelija ja kosketti  Condyn käsivarteen. »Herra Echert ja herra Hendrich ja herra George Hands ja joitakuita  muita herroja on pelisalissa ja he haluavat puhutella teitä ja herra  Sargeantia.» »Ah», sanoi herra Sargeant, »en tiennyt heidän olevan täällä. He ovat  varmasti järjestäneet pienen pelierän. Menemmekö ottamaan siihen osaa,  Condy?» Condy muisti, että hän oli aivan rahaton. »Minulla on Matti taskussa, Tracy», selitti hän silmiään räpäyttämättä. Sargeant ja hän olivat hyviä tuttuja. »Ei, minä en ota osaa peliin, mutta minä tulen hetkiseksi katsomaan.» He menivät pelisaliin, jossa ilma oli paksuna kirvelevästä  sikaarihaiusta, ja vain kahisevat jettonit katkaisivat hiljaisuuden.  He pelasivat pokeria. Kahtakymmentä minuuttia myöhemmin istui Condykin  pelaamassa. Sargeant oli lainannut hänelle tarvittavat rahat. Condy, joka muuten oli niin puhelias ja levoton, oli nyt äkkiä  ikäänkuin kovettunut ja jähmettynyt. Hän istui siinä tuolillaan,  taipumattoman äänettömänä, melkeinpä karskina. Hän oli aina herkkä  kiihoittumaan, ja nyt olivat kaikki hänen sielunkykynsä äärimmilleen  jännitetyt. Hänen hermonsa olivat kuin harpunkielet, kierretyt ja  jännitetyt niin lujalle, että ne ehkä saattoivat murtua, vaan eivät  väristä. Veri poistui hänen poskiltaan, hänen huulensa kävivät  kuiviksi. Kirjoitus, joka hänen piti kirjoittaa, hänen lupauksensa  Blixille, koko tuo hauska ja onnellinen päivä, käsitys ajasta  ja paikasta, kaikki haipui tuon pirullisen, hillittömän kiihkon  tieltä, joka yhdellä otteella oli saanut hänet valtaansa ja nyt  ruoski ja kannusti häntä eteenpäin ja yhä vain eteenpäin yltyvässä  kiihoituksessa. Hänen maailmansa supistui viheriällä veralla  päällystettyyn pyöreään pöytään, muutamaan pinkkaan kolmivärisiä  pelirahoja ja viiteen alati vaihtuvaan korttiin, jotka tulivat ja  menivät ja tulivat taas hänen väsyneiden silmiensä eteen, niinkuin  vaihtuvat väri- ja kuvasikermät kuvakiikarissa. Kello löi yksitoista,  kaksitoista, yksi, kaksi, kolme, neljä. Yhä vain ajoi intohimo häntä  niinkuin painajainen, se piti vallassaan hänen rasittuneen ruumiinsa ja  kiihoitti hänen peräti kidutettuja aivojaan. Vihdoinkin kello puoli viisi, jolloin Condy oli täsmälleen siinä mistä  hän oli alkanut, t.s. kun hän ei ollut menettänyt eikä voittanut  mitään, päätettiin yksimielisesti lopettaa, ja pelaajat lähtivät pois.  Condy kulki jalkaisin kotiin hotelliin, jossa hän äitineen asui, ja  hän meni levolle juuri kun ensimmäiset maitorattaat näyttäytyivät ja  sanomalehtipojat tulivat aamulehtineen kadulle ja tarjosivat niitä  huutaen kaupaksi. Kun hänen rasittuneet silmänsä vihdoinkin sulkeutuivat, alkoi  lopen väsyneiden aivojen kummallinen pikamaalaus verkkokalvolle.  Pikaisessa järjestyksessä pyörivät päivän kuvat hänen sulkeutuneiden  silmiensä mykiöiden läpi. Condy näki taas kuin välähdyksessä kadun  ja Blixin seisovan siellä odottamassa raitiotievaunua. Sitten  seurasi sataman hilpeä ja raikas touhu, vanha perämies kajuutassaan  hylkeenpyytäjälaivalla, kiinalaiskaupunki ja siellä eräässä  rautakalterissa loistava heleänpunainen silkkiruusuke, kullattu  seinäsola, vilahdus viheriäisellä plazalla olevasta Stevensonin  laivasta, Blix, joka soitti banjoa, ihmistyhjä kiinalainen teetalo,  jossa vallitsi viehättävä, taiteellinen hämminki; sitten taas Blix,  joka käänsi niskansa hänelle, että hän sitoisi hänen harsonsa, jota  hän valkoisiin glacehansikkaihin puettujen sormiensa päillä piteli;  ja sitten taas vielä kerran Blix, käyden hänen rinnallaan, pukevassa  mustassa hameessaan, pyöreässä pienessä turbaanihatussa, keltaisine  hiuksineen ja tummine, pienine, vilkkaine silmineen. Sitten muisti hän äkkiä lupauksen, jonka hän oli antanut tytölle,  että hän olisi sinä iltana pelaamatta. Hän tunsi itsensä aivan  masentuneeksi; tämä muisto ahdisti häntä ja kiusasi häntä. Hän ponnisti  vastaan, vaan ei voinut muuta kuin halveksia itseään. Olihan hän  rikkonut saman hänelle antamansa lupauksen ennenkin — ennen tuota  päivää, jolloin he kävivät kiinalaisessa ravintolassa — tuntematta  mitään tuskaa tuottavaa katumusta. Olivatko he sittenkin tulleet  lähemmäksi toisiaan? Sitä ei uskoisi; olivathan he niin nykyisin  sanoneet hyvästi »tyhmyyksille». »Se ei ole koskaan ennen minua kiusannut», muniisi Condy kääntäen  pielusta, »se ei ole koskaan ennen minua kiusannut. Minkätähden se  minusta nyt tuntuu niin pahalta. Se kiusaa minua hornan tavalla. Mutta  hän käsitti tuon ’45 asteen kulman»’. V. Condy oli jäänyt viikkotyössään jälkeen. Tiistai-aamuna hänet  päänalunen petti, ja hänen täytyi mennä sanomalehtitoimistoon,  sillä hänellä ei ollut sentiäkään taskussa. Hän tuli liian myöhään  ja tapasi latojat hurjan käsikirjoitusnälkäisinä. Toimittaja kysyi  heti oliko kirjoitus hylkeenpyytäjästä valmis, ja Condyn täytyi  luvata valmistaa se puolessa tunnissa. Niin nopeasti ei hän voinut  suorittaa omaa aatettaan, hänen täytyi sentähden kyhätä se kokoon  pörssi-ilmoituksista. Hänen pääasiallisesti suorastaan toisen  kädestä lähtenyt kuvauksensa laivasta ja selontekonsa sen matkasta  oli aivan yksinkertaisesti vain palstan täytettä. Siinä ei ollut  selväpiirteisyyttä eikä pontta. Kuvitusta ei siinä myöskään ollut.  Kirjoitus oli lyhyesti sanoen epäonnistunut. Parin päivän kuluttua hankki Condy kuitenkin itselleen hyvitystä  tunteellisen näyttelijättären sukkelalla haastattelulla ja arvokkaalla  tutkimuksella »Japanin teollisuuden renessanssista» — joka perustui  tietosanakirjaan ja Lafcadio Hearnin tunnin kestävään tarkastukseen. Mutta uudelleen ja uudelleen palasivat hänen ajatuksensa  sukeltajajuttuun, ja torstai-iltana, kun hän oli syönyt, meni hän  klubiin ja kätkeytyi kirjaston nurkkapulpetin ääreen, jossa hän  innostuksen puuskassa kirjoitti sen parilla tuhannella sanalla.  Saadakseen oikein kiinni »teknillisistä erityiskohdista», joihin hän  pani niin suurta painoa, turvautui hän taas käsikirjoihin ja käytti  koko joukon erikoisia käänteitä ja kummallisia sanontatapoja. Hän  oli niin ylpeä tuloksesta, ettei hän mitenkään voinut odottaa kunnes  novelli olisi painettu; hänen täytyi heti nähdä mitenkä se vaikutti;  hänen oli saatava kiitosta ja kehoitusta aivan heti. Hän ajatteli  Blixiä. »Hän keksi painopisteen Morrowbie Juken hietasärkkäkuvauksessa», sanoi  hän itsekseen, ja minuuttia myöhemmin oli hän päättänyt mennä tytön  luokse seuraavana iltana lukemaan kirjoittamansa. Se oli torstai. Koko viikon oli Blix pysytellyt rauhassa ja ollut  kotona joka ilta; viimeisten kahden vuoden kuluessa oli hänelle näin  sattunut ensimmäisen kerran, joka aamu oli hän auttanut Victorinea  aamuaskareissa, koonnut vuoteet ja pyyhkinyt pölyt; hän oli tehnyt  kauppaa teurastajan rengin ja myymäläpalvelijan kanssa keittiöt ovella  ja tinkinyt vihannesten hinnasta kohteliaasti hymyilevien kiinalaisten  kanssa. Hän oli niin selvillä taloudesta kuin viidestä sormestaan ja  piteli kaiken johdon käsissään. Kun Laurie Flagg keskiviikko-iltana  tuli tiedustamaan hänen vointiaan ja valitti hänen äkillistä  katoamistaan, tapasi hän hänen pareillaan panemassa uudinta ruokasaliin. Mutta iltapäivät ja illat olivat Blixillä kokonaan vapaasti  käytettävinään. Nämä tunnit, jotka ennen olivat kuluneet  kaikellaisiin seurusteluvelvollisuuksiin ja huveihin, tuntuivat  hänestä riippumattomuusjulistuksensa jälkeisenä viikkona jotakuinkin  pitkiltä. Mutta keskiviikkoiltapäivänä oli kaunis ja lämmin ilma,  ja hän meni puistoon »Kadetin» kanssa. Aivan odottamatta joutui hän  äkkiarvaamatta pienen japanilaisen teetalon edustalle, tai oikeammin  pieneen japanilaiseen puutarhalaitokseen pelkkine leikkikalutaloineen  ja huvihuoneineen, jossa viidellä sentillä saattoi saada teetä  ohukaisten hedelmävohvelien kera. Blix ja Detti menivät sisälle.  Siellä ei ollut vieraita, oli vain pieni japanilainen tarjoilijatyttö.  Detti oli seikkailun vuoksi seitsemännessä taivaassa ja Blix vietti  mitä miellyttävimmin puoli-tuntisen nauttimalla japanilaista teetä  ja murentamalla vohvelia karpeille ja kultakaloille, joita oli aivan  heidän pöytänsä vieressä olevassa lammikossa. Muuan kiinalainen,  näköään kauppapalvelija tai jotain sen tapaista, tuli kiinalaisen  naisen seurassa ja asettui erään pöydän ääreen. Kun nuori japanitar  tuli kysymään mitä he halusivat, kuuli Blix miehen sanovan englannin  kielellä: »Anna teetä hänelle, nainen.» »Hänen täytyy puhua englanninkieltä», kuiskasi Blix Detille, »eikö ole  suurenmoista! Huomasitko sitä?» Kotimatkalla mietiskeli Blix, kuinka hän saisi illan kulumaan.  Oikeastaan olisi hänen pitänyt olla teatterissa muutamain muiden  nuorten kanssa, joiden joukossa oli myös Jack Carter. Silloin tuli hän  äkkiä ajatelleeksi kertomuksia »Morrowbie Jukes», »Imrin kotiintulo»  ja »Krisjna Mulvaney». Sen sijaan että olisi lähtenyt suoraan kotiin  ajoi hän kaupungille ja tuli liian myöhään kotiin illalliselle, mutta  mukanaan oli hänellä Kiplingin »Suorat kertomukset» ja »Monenlaisia  päähänpistoja». Lähemmä yhdeksän soitettiin ovikelloa. Blix oli paraillaan Suddhoosin  talossa, jossa hän istui yläkerran huoneessa ja värisi kaivertajan  noitakeinojen aiheuttamasta miellyttävästä kauhusta. Kun ovikello  soi, hypähti hän ylös ja katsoi ympärilleen. Condy Rivers se ei  ollut, sen hän kuuli. Keskiviikko-ilta, — niin, sitten se kai kaiken  mahdollisuuden nimessä oli Frank Catlin, joka tuli käynnille. Hän  oli kaunis näyte piirin nuorista miehistä, jonkinlainen hillitty  Jack Carter; hän tapasi käydä joka neljästoista päivä. Hän tekisi  epäilemättä hämäriä viittauksia viime aikoina viettämästään  irstailevasta elämästä ja kertoisi nauttineensa bromkaliumia. Hän  lavertelisi, olisi tuttavallinen ja mainitsisi häntä etunimeltä niin  usein kuin uskaltaisi, puhuisi lauantaisesta kotiljongista ja tekisi  voitavansa saadakseen hänet nauramaan Jack Carterin epäraittiudelle.  Blix tunsi tyypin. Catlin oli vastaleivottu ylioppilas; mutta toiset  nuoret tytöt, niin vieläpä 25—26 vuoden ikäiset naisetkin kehoittivat  ja hemmottelivat näitä nuoria veitikoita; sellainen puute oli oikeista  aikamiehistä. »Minä en ole kotona, Victorine», sanoi Blix palvelijattarelle, joka  hänen onnistui pysäyttää eteisessä. Ellei se ollut Frank Catlin, niin  oli se joku muu pitkä poika samaa lajia. Blix meni takaisin Suddhoosin  taloon, rouva Hawksbien ja Mulvaneyn luo mielihyvästä keveästi väristen. »On vain yksi asia, josta olen pahoillani», sanoi hän Condy Riversille,  kun tämä tuli perjantai-iltana, »ja se on se, etten ennemmin ole  päässyt näiden perille.» Sitten piti hän äkkiä kättään silmien edessä,  niinkuin olisi ollut voimakkaan valon sokaisema, ja käänsi päänsä pois. »Mikä nyt? Mikä teitä vaivaa?» kysyi Condy. Blix tirkisti varovasti häneen sormiensa lomitse. »Ooh», kuiskasi hän, »hänellä on tuo hirvittävä, punainen kravatti.» »Minun kravattini!» huudahti Condy ja järjesteli sitä hermostuneesti.  »Se on kyllin hyvä, luulisin. Tiptop! Onko se teidän mielestänne niin  huutava?» kysyi hän vähän kärsimättömästi. Blix piteli korviaan. »Condy!» sanoi hän, »te olette kaunis ja hyvä nuori mies, ja vaikkapa  teiltä mahdollisesti puuttuu muutamia loistavampia ominaisuuksia,  niin olette te kuitenkin vanhalle äidillenne hyvä ja rakastava poika,  mutta teidän ruusukkeenne ja liinanne tekevät teidät kerrassaan  mahdottomaksi.» »No, katsokaa tätä huonetta!» huusi Condy — he istuivat arkihuoneessa  — »teidän ei pidä puhua huonosta mausta. Katsokaa näitä oviverhoja. Ne  ovat keltaiset, jumala paratkoon! Katsokaa tuota keltaista ruusuketta  ja tuota sinistä ruusuketta! Ja noita kipsikuvia tuolla! Te saatte  sellaisia kaupanpäällisiksi jokaisesta kilosta teetä, jonka ostatte.  Ja tuota . ja tuota . ja tuota , valitti hän ja huitoi käsillään  kullatuilla väkipyssyillä koristettuun vesijohtoputkeen päin. »Niin,  ja te puhutte taiteesta! Te puhutte mausta! Kullattuja osmankäämejä.  Kullattuja! No niin, miksipä ei?» Hän väänteli käsiään. »Lapset ovat  onnellisia, ja —» »Hysh!» keskeytti Blix hänet. »Minä kyllä tiedän, että se on rumaa.  Mutta meillä on kerta kaikkiaan ollut näin, enkä minä tahdo siitä enää  enempää kuulla. Menkäämme mieluummin ruokasaliin. Siellä emme ole ennen  istuneet. Emme ole koskaan olleet oikein luonnollisia täällä.» He menivät ruokasaliin ja siirsivät pari nojatuolia ulkonemaan.  Siellä he sitten istuutuivat ja katselivat ulos. Kaasua ei vielä oltu  sytytetty. Oli liian varhaista vielä, arvelivat he. Noin kymmenen  minuuttia istuivat he ja katselivat ulos ikkunasta päivän kalvetessa. Suoraan ikkunan alla vietti maa niin äkkijyrkästi, että lähimpäin  talojen katot olivat jotakuinkin heidän jalkojensa tasalla. Heidän  takanaan luisui kaupunki alas lahdelmaa kohti kattojen, reunusten,  kupoolien ja savupiippujen vieremänä puolihämärän sinisessä usvassa,  josta siellä täällä näkyi vasta sytytetyn lyhdyn välähdyksiä. Sitten  tuli lahdelma. Idässä päin saattoivat he nähdä Vuohisaaren ja koko sen  purjealusten laivaston, joka ankkuroi sisemmällä satamansuussa. Mutta  suoraan heidän ikkunansa edessä nousi Alcaratzin saari äkkijyrkkänä  ja uhkarohkeana meren pinnasta linnoituksista muodostettuine  kolminkertaisine kruunuineen. Katse seurasi tätä näköpiiriä pohjoiseen ja länteen, kunnes se hitaasti  nousten, nousten, nousten äkkiä juoksi suoraan ylös taivasta kohti  Tamalpaisin huipun kera, tuon hiljaisen purppuranvärisen vuoren, joka  aina tuijotti auringon laskua kohti, niinkuin valtava, tähystävä  sfinxi. Sieltä aleni maalinja niinkuin murtuvan aallonharjan ääriviiva,  vaipuen, luisuen alas kohti Kultaista porttia — lasinvihreänä,  vetisenä, pienenä kapeana virtana vanhan linnan alla. Sitten pysähtyi  katse, tai se liiteli vain, ilman tukea ja estettä, yli äärettömän  viheriän pinnan — avonaisen valtameren. Tällä hetkellä eivät kuitenkaan seudun ääriviivat lumonneet, vaan  sen värit. Se lepäsi tummassa väriloistossa niinkuin tuomiokirkon  huone. Kaikki oli kuin kiedottu purppurausvaan — linnoituksen  matalista viheriäisistä vallirinteistä alkaen aina Mount Diabloon,  vuorijättiläiseen, joka kohotti kumaran selkänsä lahden toisella  puolella olevien matalampien vuoriharjanteiden takaa. Ilma vaaleni  vähitellen. Valovyö lännessä paloi tummaksi hehkuksi, joka heitti  kuparikiillon yli lahdelman syvän sinen. Matalammat vuoriharjanteet  toisella puolen, Diablo ja taaimmaisena Tamalpais, piiloutuivat  sametinharmaisiin ilmahuntuihin. Ääriviivat häipyivät. Ainoastaan  massat säilyivät ja nekin alkoivat sulautua yhteen. Ilma ja maa ja  kaupungin rakennusryhmät yhtyivät. Ainoastaan tumma hehku oli vielä  jäljellä ja halkoi tuon kaikkea saartavan purppuran kultaisella  säilällä. »Tuolla tulee laiva», sanoi Blix hiljaa. Nelimastoinen liukui tyvenesti ulos Kultaisesta portista uiden  kullassa ja purppurassa niinkuin varjo punaisine ja viheriäisine  valopilkkuineen. Sitten liukui sen varjokaari sisään ja katosi  linnoituksen varjoon. Punainen valo oli poissa ja suurmasto, koko  laiva. Keskiyöllä olisi se kaukana mantereesta, keinuen Tyvenen meren  yksinäisillä mainingeilla kuun valkoisessa valossa. Condy ja Blix istuivat hiljaa, liikahtamatta; he pelkäsivät rikkoa  tunnelmaa. Viisi pitkää minuuttia jäivät he näin istumaan ja näkivät  tähtien syttyvän toisen toisensa jälkeen, sillä välin kun suuri, harmaa  yö laskeutui leveänä ja laajana vuorenhuipulta veden pintaan. Heidän  ei tarvinnut keskustella. Heidän äänettömyydessään ei nyt ollut mitään  painostavaa. Varovaisesti ja pienin tempauksin käänsi Condy päätään ja katsoi  Blixiin. Hän saattoi nähdä hänet vielä. Hän istui taapäin nojaten  kädet helmassa ja kasvot hiukan vinosti ylöspäin. Tavallisuuden mukaan  oli hän mustiin puettu, mutta hänellä oli yllään iltapuku, joka jätti  kaulan ja käsivarret vapaiksi. Leuan ja kaulan piirteissä ja hartioiden  miellyttävässä pyöreydessä oli jotakin tavattoman sopusointuista — jota  mahdollisesti saattoi tulkita sävelin, vaan ei sanoin. Hänen hiuksensa  häämöittivät niinkuin heikosti loistava usva. Hänen silmiensä väriä ja  poskiensa rusoa saattoi vain aavistaa, niinkuin pieniä tähtiä, jotka  katoavat, kun kiinnittää katseensa niihin. Ja Condysta tuntui, että  hänestä virtasi jotakin sanomatonta, jotakin, jota saattoi tajuta vain  mystillisellä kuudennella aistilla ja joka heräsi vain tällaisina  hiljaisina hetkinä. Milloin se oli kuin hillitty valoloiste, milloin  melkein kuin huomaamaton tuoksu, milloin taas kuin näkymätön heilahdus  eetterissä, vaikutus, aistimus vain. Oli niinkuin hänen raikas suloutensa, hänen puhdas ja kirkas  naisellisuutensa olisi ottanut erikoisen muodon, muodon, jota hänen  tavalliset aistimensa olivat liian karkeat tajuamaan. Vain vissi  epämääräinen hellyys hänessä virtasi ulos kohtaamaan ja vastaanottamaan  tuota näkymätöntä, joka kuitenkin siellä oli; eikä tämä hellyys  koskenut vain häntä, vaan kaikkea hyvää koko maailmassa. Hän oli usein  tuntenut jotakin samantapaista kuullessaan soittoa. Blixin hyvyys  ja kauneus herätti hänessä kaiken sen, mikä hänessä parasta oli,  ajatteli hän. Ja hän oli vain yhdeksäntoistavuotias. Äkkiä paisui hänen  sydämensä, hänen kurkkuaan kuristi ja hänen silmiään kirveli. »Tiedättekö, Blix, mitä minä toivoisin», sanoi hän melkein kuiskaten;  »toivoisin olevani parempi ihminen kuin olen.» »Sen toivominen on alku siksi tulemiseen, ettekö usko sitä, Condy?»  vastasi hän ja käänsi käden varassa olevat kasvonsa häneen. »On ikävää», jatkoi Condy, »että kun todellakin haluaa toimia oikein ja  moitteettomasti ja tuntea hienosti ja ajatella jalosti, ettei siiloin  oma olento ota mukautuakseen sen mukaan. Saattaa kyllä hetkisen luulla  että niin on laita, mutta on niin tavattoman vaikeata pysyttää se!» »Niin, luonnollisesti, Condy, siinähän se juuri on, että siitä on  pidettävä kiinni. Niin se on, ansaitsee olla hyvä, kun vihdoinkin  tulee siksi; ettekö usko niin olevan? Se on kestävyys, joka tekee  voimakkaaksi niin, että hyvyys on jonkin arvoinen. Mitä hyötyä on  heikon miehen hyvyydestä? Kun hyvyys on parempi kuin itse onkaan?  On oltava yhtä voimakas kuin hyvä. Ne, jotka kykenevät toimittamaan  jotakin hyvyydellään, ovat sitä oikeata lajia. Se on ainakin minun  mielipiteeni.» »Niin, siinä on perää. Kyllä, siinä on perää.» Ja hetkisen kuluttua hän  sanoi: »Minä pelasin kuitenkin korttia maanantaina, Blix, vaikka olin  luvannut olla pelaamatta.» Blix oli kauan vaiti. Mutta kun hän vihdoin vastasi, oli hänen äänensä  tyyni. »No niin. Olen iloinen siitä, että kerroitte sen itse minulle.»  Sitten hän lisäsi: »Ettekö voi olla pelaamatta, Condy?» »Olla pelaamatta? Voin — kyllä, luonnollisesti — ooh, Blix, minä  olen toisinaan täydessä kapinassa itseäni vastaan. Te ette tiedä  millaista se on. Nuori tyttö ei tietenkään voi käsittää mikä vetovoima  pelillä on; se on aivan kuin joku valta. Sen laita ei ole kuin muiden  asiain, niitä voi paremmin — mutta uhkapeliin nähden on minussa kuin  toinen olento, ja se tekee mitä tahtoo kysymättä minulta . Mutta  minä ponnistan nyt todellakin. En ole sen jälkeen korttiin koskenut,  vaikka totta totisesti siihen on tilaisuutta ollut. Tämä kortti-asia,  katsokaa, on vain erityinen puoli klubielämää, meidän elämäämme  kaupungissa, niinkuin juominen ja — muut paheet. Jos minä eläisin  toisissa olosuhteissa tai jos minä en olisi missään tekemisissä  täkäläisen seuran kanssa, Sargeantin ja muiden, niin olisi toinen asia;  olisi paljon helpompi, luulen.» »Mutta miehellä pitäisi olla voimaa olla oma itsensä ja hallita  itseään, olipa hän sitten missä tahansa. Oikea mies, Condy, on  mielestäni paras ja kaunein mitä maailmassa on.» »Minun mielestäni se on kelpo nainen.» »Niin, minä katson kai asiaa naisen kannalta, mutta minusta on oikea  mies — mies, joka on voimakas kaikin tavoin — suurin kaikesta mitä on.  Me naiset rakastamme nyt kerta kaikkiaan miehuullista voimaa. Oikealle  miehelle saatamme melkein antaa kaikki anteeksi.» Condy ei heti vastannut, ja sillä välin sai Blix ajatuksen, joka heti  kypsyi päätökseksi. Mutta hän ei sanonut mitään. Aurinko oli laskenut;  tunnelma oli häipynyt; he olivat nähtävästi puhuneet asian loppuun.  Blix nousi sytyttämään kaasun. »Tahdotteko luvata minulle jotakin,  Condy?» sanoi hän. »Mutta vain siinä tapauksessa että itse haluatte.  Lupaatteko ilmoittaa minulle joka kerta, kun olette pelannut?» »Kyllä, sen uskallan teille luvata!» huudahti Condy. »Ja sen lupauksen  pidän.» »No, luetaanpa nyt sitten tuo kertomus — tai se, mitä teillä on siitä  valmiina.» He vetivät tuolinsa ruokapöydän luo, jolla oli valkoreunainen sininen  flanelliliina, ja Condy avasi käsikirjoituskäärönsä ja luki mitä hän  oli kirjoittanut. Se miellytti Blixiä, ja hän huomasi, niinkuin Condy  oli arvannut, jokaisen »hyvän kohdan». Hän oli melkein huutamaisillaan  ihastuksesta, kun Blix keskeytti hänet: »Luulisi melkein, että te itse olette ollut sukeltaja tai ainakin  seurustellut sukeltajain kanssa. Pikku piirteet ovat vaikuttavat;  olette käyttänyt niitä oivallisesti. Mutta kuulkaapa nyt, Condy! Olen  saanut ajatuksen. Saammepa nähdä mitä siitä sanotte. Elkää antako  kertomuksen loppua siihen, että sukeltaja tulee ylös ja jättää tytön  sinne. Se kuuluu myös kertomukseen, luonnollisesti, mutta sitten  pitää hänen tulla takaisin monen vuoden perästä, kun hän jo on vanha  mies. Sen voitte kyllä käsitettäväsi selittää. Antakaa hänen sitten  sukeltaa meren pohjaan vielä kerran katsomaan tyttöä, mutta ei enää  koskaan tulla ylös — mitä? Eikä lukijan tarvitse tietää tuliko hänelle  tapaturma vai jäikö hän vapaaehtoisesti.» Condy päästi riemuhuudon ja löi polveaan. »Te olette maailman kahdeksas  ihme, Blix! Se on suurenmoista, se on loistavaa! Kuulkaa —», hän  katseli häntä uteliaasti. — »Teidän pitäisi todellakin itse antautua  kirjoittamaan.» »Se ei juolahda ikinä mieleenikään», sanoi hän päättävästi. »Minä pysyn  laulussani ja olen tyytyväinen siihen. Mutta muistakaa nyt, että ette  anna Timesille kertomusta. Ainakaan ei missään tapauksessa ennenkun  olette kokeeksi käyttänyt sitä tuossa — Riemukustannusliikkeessä.» »Elkää pelätkö!» äyhkäisi Condy pilkallisesti. »Siitähän tulee parasta  mitä milloinkaan olen kirjoittanut.» Vähän myöhemmin kysyi hän hiukan arasti: »Onkohan talossa jotakin  syötävää?» »Minä en ikinä ole nähnyt moista miestä!» huudahti Blix. »Teillä sitten  on aina nälkä.» »Minusta on mieluista syödä», myönsi hän. »No niin, hankinpa teille vähän simpukoita mayonnaisissa», ehdotti Blix, »kelpaako?» Condy pyöritti silmiään. »Sanotteko simpukoita mayonnaisissa, niinkö?»  Ja hän selitti juhlallisesti: »En ole ikipäivinäni saanut niin monta  simpukkaa, kuin olisin halunnut syödä.» Blix meni keittiöön laittamaan mayonnaisia, ja Condy meni mukaan. He  söivät simpukkansa siellä yhteen menoon; Condy istuen pesupenkillä  lautanen polvellaan. Condylla oli tapana temmata itselleen joku ulottuvissa oleva esine ja  tarkastella sitä, niinkuin näytti suuresti mielenkiintoisena, samalla  kun hän jatkoi keskustelua. Tällä kertaa oli se aamulehti, jonka  Victorine oli jättänyt keittiön pöydälle. Hän oli milloin ottanut sen  käteensä, milloin pannut sen pois ja väliajoilla katseineen liukunut  läpi palstojen otsa rypyssä, tietämättä mitä näki. Nyt näkyi hän äkkiä  kiintyvän johonkin ja luki ääneen. »Yksityistä. Nuori nainen, 31 vuoden vanha, perehtynyt taloustoimiin,  haluaa tutustua kunnioitettavan keski-ikäiseen herraan. Jos  molemminpuolinen mieltymys herää, avioliitto. Vastas merkittynä K.D.B. . tämän lehden konttoriin.» »Hm», huomautti hän, »tässä K.D.B:ssä ei ole mitään arveluttavaa,  hänellä on rohkeutta sanoa itseään nuoreksi 31 vuoden vanhana. Lyönpä  vaikka vetoa, että hän on taitava taloudenhoitajatar. Aivan oikein.  K.D.B. ei ole löytänyt mitä on toivonut, sentâhden tiedustelee hän.» »Haluaisin tietää», mumisi Blix, »mitä lajia ne ihmiset ovat, jotka  panevat lehtiin tällaisia ilmoituksia. Niinkuin nyt K.D.B., kenen  luulette hänen olevan?» »Hän ei ole pahimpia», vakuutti Condy. »Minä näen niin monta heistä  tuolla toimistossa. Enimmäkseen ovat he suorasukaisia, käytännöllisiä  ihmisiä, jotka tietävät mitä tekevät; tavallisesti vanhemmanpuoleisia  naisia — noin kolmenkymmenenyhden vaiheilla; nuoruuden hullutukset ja  haaveet heittäneitä — he tahtovat kernaasti saada oman kodin.» »Lukekaa muutamia vielä», pyysi Blix. Condy jatkoi: »25 vuoden vanha  nuorimies, levollinen ja lemmekäs luonne, hienosti sivistynyt ja  hyvässä asemassa oleva, pyrkii nuoren ja hyvän kasvatuksen saaneen  nuoren naisen tuttavuuteen. Rehelliset tarkoitukset. Mc B. Sanomalehden  konttori.» »Ei, häntä en voi kärsiä», sanoi Blix. »Hän on liian — liian hienosti  koristeltu, tämä Mc B.» »Hän ei kai sovi K.B.D:lle, vai kuinka?» »Hänkö? Hän tekisi hänet hirveän onnettomaksi.» »Leskimies, kahden lapsen isä, luonteeltaan kodikas, haluaa  kirjevaihtoon kunnollisen, lempeäluonteisen naisen kanssa, joka  suostuisi olemaan äidin sijaisena hänen molemmille lapsilleen.  Avioliitto mahdollinen. Vastaus merkitty K.T.I. vastaanotetaan tämän  lehden konttorissa.» »Siitä ei ole K.D.B:lle, se on selvää», päätti Blix. »Ajatella vain  tuota: ’Avioliitto mahdollinen!’ Se on korskea herra. Hän on varmasti  jo aikoja sitten kuluttanut lapsenkenkänsä. Olen vakuutettu siitä,  että hän tahtoisi saada K.D.B:n lämmittämään sukkansa ja että hän on  suunnattoman kärttyinen ja vaativa. K.T.I. on luonnollisesti lyhennys  sanasta kotityranni. Hänet hyljätään.» Seuraavat pari kolme ilmoitusta luki Condy itsekseen huolimatta Blixin  huomautuksista. »Se on alhaisesti teiltä, Condy! Minä tahdon kuulla mitä siellä vielä  on.» »Kuulkaa!» huudahti Condy. »Tässä on eräs K.D.B:lle sopiva. Kas, ylkä  tulee. Kuulkaa nyt.» »Nuorimies, kolmenkymmenenyhdeksän vuoden ikäinen, raitis ja työteliäs,  ent. merikapteeni, haluaa tutustua kunnioitettuun nuoreen naiseen,  joka kykenee hoitamaan kotia. Avioliitto mahdollinen. Vastaus merkitty  ’Kapteeni Jack’ tämän lehden konttoriin.» »Olen varma siitä, että hänellä on puujalka!» sanoi Blix. »Ettekö voi  nähdä kuinka se pistää rivien välistä esille. Ja hän asuu pienessä  talossa lahdelman rannalla yksin papukaijansa kanssa —» »Ja valmistaa oivallisen todin joka ilta.» »Ja polttaa tupakkaa pitkällä liitupiipulla.» »Hän pureksiikin tupakkaa.» »Niin, eikö ole ilkeätä, että hän on niin sikamainen. Se vasta haisee! Mutta K.D.B. saa sen kyllä pian pois.» »Niin, hän on juuri oikea mies K.D.B.lle.» »Sallimuksen ohjaus», ratkaisi Blix. »Nuo molemmat ovat luodut toisiaan  varten. Katsokaahan, K.D.B. on taitava talousihminen ja etsii arvoisaa  keski-ikäistä herraa. Kapteeni Jack on arvokas keski-ikäinen herra ja  etsii naista, joka kykenee hoitamaan kotia. Minulla on selvä tunne  siitä, että he sopivat toisilleen. Jos he ymmärtävät omaa parastaan,  niin kirjoittavat he heti toisilleen.» »Mutta te haluatte olla läsnä, kun he ensi kerran kohtaavat  toisensa», sanoi Condy. »Emmekö voi laittaa niin, että asia tulee järjestetyksi?» kysyi Blix.  »Meidän täytyy saada ne kaksi viedyksi yhteen; meidän täytyy auttaa  heitä jollakin tavalla.» Condy löi pöytään ja hyppäsi alas. »Minä kirjoitan heille!» huusi hän. »Kirjoitan K.D.B.lle kapteeni Jackin nimessä ja kapteeni Jackille — — —» »K.D.B:n nimessä», jatkoi Blix haltioituneena päähänpistosta. »Ja annan kapteenin ehdottaa hänelle ja hänen ehdottaa kapteenille  kohtausta», lisäsi Condy. »Ja sitten menemme me itse myös paikalle ja  katselemme heitä ilman että he aavistavat mitään.» »Mutta miten me tunnemme heidät. Ja miten he tuntevat toisensa. Nehän  ovat aivan vieraita toisilleen.» »Annamme heidän käyttää vissiä kukkaa. Niin tehdään aina tällaisissa  tapauksissa. Se on varsin helppoa. Mutta niin pian kuin he alkavat  keskustella, täytyy heidän luonnollisesti huomata, ettei kumpikaan  heistä ole kirjoittanut.» »Niin, kyllä, mutta siitä he eivät välitä.» »Ei — hehän juuri haluavat tavata toisiaan. He ovat meille kiitolliset  avunannosta.» »Siitä tulee suurenmoinen huvinäytelmä!» »Huvinäytelmä! Siitä tulee kerrassaan draama. Vain sen vuoksi jo, että  me asetamme sen näyttämölle ja että se on totta kaikki tyyni. Pankaamme  se täytäntöön.» Blix juoksi kamariinsa ja toi sieltä kirjoitusvehkeet. Condy tutki  kriitillisesti kirjoituspaperia. »Se on liian komeaa, tämä. K.D.B. ei sinä ilmoisna ikänä käyttäisi  irlantilaista palttinapaperia! Kiilloitettu siniraitainen, jossa  on pääskynen kulmassa, on sopivampaa. Nyt kirjoitan minä kapteenin  puolesta ja te kirjoitatte K.D.B:n puolesta.» »Mutta missä me annamme heidän tavata toisensa?» Tämä oli tärkeä kohta.  He ajattelivat kiinalaista ravintolaa, espanjalaista toria, Lotan  kaivoa, Käsityöläisyhdistyksen kirjastoa, niin, vieläpä katolilaista  tuomiokirkkoakin, mutta he eivät voineet sopia yhdestäkään noista  paikoista. »Oletteko milloinkaan kuullut puhuttavan Lunan ravintolasta?» kysyi  Condy. »Se on sitten hiljainen paikka! Siellä syödään parhaiten  espanjalaiseen tapaan; keskellä latinalaista neliötä; tyven pieni  vanhanaikainen ravintola suuressa kellarissa, säädyllinen kuin hauta.  Minä olen ollut siellä vain kerran. Annamme heidän kohdata toisensa  siellä kello seitsemän iltasella. Siihen aikaan ei siellä ole yhtä  ihmistä. Ravintolassa ei ole suurta liikettä ja se suljetaan kello  kahdeksan, niin että me voimme mennä sinne ja syödä päivällistä kuuden  ajoissa ja olla siellä, kun he tulevat.» Sitten ryhtyivät he kirjeitä kirjoittamaan. »Asia on nyt niin», sanoi Condy, »että meidän on saatava kirjeet aivan  luonnollisiksi. On ihmisiä, jotka heti vetäytyvät pois, jos aavistavat  pienintäkään petosta. Teidän on kirjoitettava ei niinkuin te itse tahtoisitte sen kirjoitetuksi, vaan niinkuin hän tahtoisi. Se on  taidetta, jonkinlaista runoilemista, ymmärrättehän. Meidän täytyy  kuvitella määrättyä luonnetta ja antaa ajatusjuoksun ja sanonnan  sopeutua sen mukaan. Minä tarkoitan, että sen on oltava luonnollista.  Tuossa on nyt ensin K.D.B. Hyvä. Hän on ennenkaikkea järjestyksen  ihminen. Hän on arkamaisen tarkka puhtauden ja järjestyksen suhteen  ja mahtava selvästä, virheettömästä ja 'hienosta' kielestään.  On varma, että hän käyttää puolihansikkaita ja on innostunut  ruumiinpoltto-asiaan. Oletetaan. Mitä kapteeni Jackiin tulee, niin  on hänellä hirvittävä bassoääni, tuollainen vov-vov-vov, eikö niin?  Ja mahtavat turpajouhet; ja sitten hän sanoo: 'Vielä kerran!' ja  'Anna hurista!' Hän on syvä-ääninen, suuri mies ja erittäin kohtelias  naisille: Ooh, hän on mies, saakelinmoinen mies, kaunista sukupuolta  kohtaan, tämä kelpo kapteeni.» Useamman epäonnistuneen yrityksen jälkeen saivat he vihdoinkin  valmiiksi seuraavat kaksi kirjelmää, jotka Condy samana iltana pisti  kirjelaatikkoon: »Kapteeni Jackille! Suuresti kunnioitettu herra! Minä olen suurella myötätunnolla lukenut teidän yksityisen   ilmoituksenne The Timesissä. Minulle olisi mieluista tehdä lähempää   tuttavuutta Teidän kanssanne. Osaan lukea rivien lomitse ja olen   saanut kumoamattoman varmuuden Teidän oikeamielisyydestänne ja   arvokkuudestanne. Luulen voivani empimättä myöntää Teille suullisen   keskustelun. Te voitte tavata minut Lunan ravintolassa ensi   maanantai-iltana täsmälleen kl. 7. Tunnusmerkkinä on minulla kimppu   valkoisia papinkukkia ja odotan, että Teillä on samanlainen kukka   nutun pielessä. Toivoen että nämä rivit tapaavat Teidät terveenä olen Teidän nöyrä K.D.B. .» »Neiti K.D.B:lle! Korkeasti kunnioitettu Neiti! Teidän kaino ja pidättäytyvä kuvauksenne omasta luonteestanne ja  persoonallisista eduistanne saa minut uskomaan että minä teissä  löytäisin miellyttävän toverin elämän tiellä. Olen pitävä suurena  kunniana ja suosiona, jos Te suvaitsisitte myöntää persoonallisen  kohtauksen. Ensi tulevana maanantaina säntilleen kl. 7 iltasella tulen  Lunan meksikkolaiseen ravintolaan. Nöyrä ja harras toivoni on tavata  Teidät siellä. Se on hiljainen ja säädyllinen paikka. Minulla on  nutunpielessä valkoinen papinkukka ja pyydän Teitä pitämään kädessänne  vihkon samoja kukkasia. Alati Teidän nöyrin palvelijanne Kapteeni Jack .» Blix oli niin huvitettu tästä jutusta, että hän vielä kaiken lisäksi  seurasi Condya alas kirjelaatikolle ollakseen oikein varma, että  kirjeet tulivat varmasti lähetetyiksi. Condy voisi unohtaa kaikki  tyyni, heti kun joutui oven ulkopuolelle. »Kunpa ne nyt vaikuttaisivat», huudahti hän, kun kansi paukahti kiinni  ja kirjeet katosivat. Mutta Condy tunsi itsensä äkkiä kummallisen  alakuloiseksi ja tyytymättömäksi koko asiaan. »Oi, kunpa emme sentään olisi sitä tehneet! Kunpa emme olisi sitä  tehneet!» huusi hän kauhistuneena. »Nyt olemme hienosti kiinni.» Yhä pahojen aavistusten painamana seurasi hän Blixiä takaisin tämän  ovelle, jossa hän sanoi hyvää yötä. Blix ei mennyt heti levolle vaan poikkesi isänsä luo, jonka hän tapasi  paraillaan täydessä työssä korjaamassa schwarzwaldilaiskelloa, jonka  hän oli purkanut sadoiksi kappaleiksi väittäen siinä olevan jonkun vian  — se edisti. Blix istahti matolle hänen eteensä. »Kuules, isä,» sanoi hän, »silloin  kun sinä 60-luvulla ensin tulit tänne ja kaivoit kultaa, pelasitko  silloin pookeria?» »Minäkö? Pelasin totta totisesti. Siihen aikaan ei meillä ollut muuta  millä olisimme huvitelleet.» »Tahtoisitko opettaa minulle sitä?» »Haluatko sinä sitä oppia?» Herra Bessemer pani kellon esiliinaansa ja tuijotti tyttäreensä. Mutta Blix selitti hänelle syynsä. VI. Lauantaina oli Blix aikonut mennä pitkälle kävelyretkelle  linnoitukselle päin. Mutta kun hän aamiaispöydässä paraillaan tuumaili  ottaako mukaansa Howardin vai Dettenin, vaiko ehkä mieluummin jonkun  Kiplingin kirjoista, tuli pikalähetti tuoden kirjeen Condylta. »Kaikki on menetetty», kirjoitti tämä. »Minä olen saanut  ptomaimnyrkytyksen eilen iltaisesta simpukkamayonnaisista ja saan maata  vähintäin neljätoista päivää. Minulla on ollut kauhea yö. Ettekö voisi  pistäytyä täysihoitolassa iltapäivän kuluessa? Silloin on äiti kotona.» »Ptomainmyrkytys!» Sehän on kauheaa. Tohtori oli siis ollut siellä!  Blix päätti siirtää kävelyretken ja heti mennä rouva Riversin luo  kuulemaan kuinka Condy voi. Hän meni portaita alas jo kymmenen ajoissa — ja siellä tapasi hän Condyn nousemassa portaita ylös, pyöräilypuvussa ja savuke suussa. »Olen yhdentoista dollarin omistaja!» huusi tämä hilpeästi hänelle. »Minä luulin teillä olevan ptomainmyrkytyksen!» vastasi Blix  harmistuneena. »Joutavia! Niin, tohtori sanoi; hän puhuu kukkaronsa puolesta. Se  olikin vain jonkinlaista vatsatautia; nyt se on ohi. Minä olen terve  kuin kala — ja minulla on yksitoista dollaria taskussa. Menkäämme ulos  nauttimaan elämästä.» »Eikö teidän ole mentävä toimistoon?» »Siellä ei kukaan minua odota, luulinhan että tulisin sairaaksi;  soitin siis sinne, ja he sanoivat, ettei se tee mitään; he saattoivat  hyvin selviytyä ilman minua. Minulla on yksitoista dollaria taskussa  ja meillä on kolme säteilevän ihanaa vapaapäivää käytettävänämme:  lauantai, sunnuntai ja maanantai! Mitä me teemme? Mitä meidän on  tehtävä tullaksemme pelastetuiksi? Meidän avioliittosuunnitelmamme  ei ole toteutettavissa ennen maanantaita. Sinne on vielä pitkälti.  Teemmekö retken kiinalaiskaupunkiin, ravintolaan vai satamaanko  uudestaan? Voimme ehkä saada perämiehen kutsumaan meidät aamiaiselle  hylkeenpyytäjälaivaan. Tai» — Condy huomasi erään kalakauppiaan, joka  juuri pyörähti kulmasta vaunuineen — »voimmehan mennä kalastamaan.» »Niin, simpukoita esimerkiksi.» Mutta Condy jatkoi: »Lähtekäämme kalastamaan, Blix.» »Minne?» »En tiedä. Missä muut ihmiset täällä ympäristöllä kalastavat. Ainakin  sinne, missä on vettä.» »Onko mahdollista?» kysyi Blix mitä suurimmalla kummastuksella. »Minä  olen aina luullut, että te kalastatte takapihalla tai mahdollisesti  arkihuoneessa.» »Olkaa nyt kiltti!» sanoi Condy. »Te nyt sitten aina pilailette.  Malttakaas kun mietin — malttakaas…» Hän rypisti otsaansa ja pyyhkäsi  hiuksensa ylös. Sitten löi hän polveensa. »Tulkaa nyt!» huudahti hän. »Nyt sen keksin!» Hän oli jo puolivälissä  portaita, kun Blix kutsui hänet takaisin. »Jättäkää se minun huolekseni», pyysi Condy hartaasti. »Luottakaa vain  minuun — tai eikö teitä haluta?» kysyi hän loukkaantuneena. »Haluta! — Kyllä, sen taivas tietäköön. Mutta —» »Hyvä, tulkaa sitten!» He nousivat kaupungin alapäähän menevään raitiovaunuun. »Minulla on pari haljennutta merenruoko-ongenvapaa», selitti Condy,  sillävälin kun he pikajunan nopeudella luisuivat alas jyrkkää  Washington-Streetiâ. »Siitä on monta vuotta kun niitä viimeksi käytin —  siihen aikaan me vielä asuimme idässä. Mutta se on käsin tehtyä työtä,  ensiluokkaista. Muut osat vehkeistä puuttuvat, mutta sitä parempi.  Varustusten tulee olla sitä mukaa kuin kalastammekin.» »Kuinka niin?» »En itsekään vielä tiedä, mutta pian minä sen selville saan.» Hän vei hänet Market-Streetin varrella olevaan kaupungin hienoimpaan  urheilutarpeiden kauppaan. Siellä oli kokonainen maailma sellaisenaan  täynnä kiusauksia, joita oli mahdoton vastustaa. Pitkiä rivejä  metsästyskiväärejä, joiden kaksoispiiput muistuttivat urkujenpiippuja;  suuria nippuja ongenvapoja, forellia ja lohia ja ahvenia varten;  kiukkuisia eri kaliberia olevia revolvereja aina Arizona-ratsuväen  44 millimetrin miehentappajiin; metsästyspuukkoja ja tikareja ja  miekkasimia, solevia kuin teräsruoskat; Winchester-kiväärit seisoivat  kärsivällisesti riveissä kaapeissaan ja odottivat puolitorkuksissa  vissiä komentohuutoa; niillä oli karski vastauksensa valmiina. Siellä  oli parvittain kummallisia kaikenvärisiä ja -vivahteisia kärpäsiä,  ruskeita, harmaita ja mustia, harmaanruskeita, harmaanmustia, joissa  siellä täällä oli loistavan punainen täplä; teloja siimoineen,  sormenpaksuisiksi punottuja sätkyttelevän kampelan vedestä vetämistä  varten tai vaaleanviheriöitä hämähäkin verkkoja, jonka hyvin  kasvanut rautakala helposti voisi repiä. Koukkuja, taljoja, painoja,  kielukkeita, tuulaimia, panoksia, kranaatteja, kaikkia urheilijaa  houkuttelevia tavaroita, jotka tuovat mieleen yksinäiset kalliotörmät,  hirven vesipaikat suolakorvessa, tunturivedet ja pienen peltopyyn maat  ja autiot suot, joissa vain siellä täällä vilisee puro tai vilahtaa  lammikko kylmänä harmaata syystaivasta vasten. Muuan kauppa-apulainen tuli heidän luokseen, ja Condy ilmoitti mitä hän  halusi. »Minä aion lähteä kalalle — me aiomme lähteä kalalle. Pitäisi olla  sellainen paikka, johon voisimme lähteä ja palata takaisin samana  päivänä, ja jossa on kunnollisesti täysin kasvaneita kaloja — ei  poikasia.» Nyt seurasi viehättävä puolituntinen; rakastettavampaa kauppa-apulaista  ei ole koskaan ollut olemassa. Oli aivan kuin hänen elämänsä ainoana  päämääränä olisi ollut, että Condy ja Blix pääsisivät kalastamaan  ja saisivat hyvän saaliin. Kansa sai odottaa hänen aprikoidessaan,  tehdessään ehdotuksia, antaessaan hyviä neuvoja ja pohtiessaan  mahdollisuuksia. Hän sanoi heille minne heidän oli ohjattava tiensä,  millä junalla heidän piti palata kotiin ja kenen puoleen heidän  oli käännyttävä siellä. He eivät voineet päästä matkaan ennenkun  maanantaiaamuna, mutta he olisivat taas takaisin ennen tuota  kohtalokasta klo 7 ip. »Kysykää vain herra Richardsonia», sanoi kauppa-apulainen, »minä annan  teille korttini. Hän saa teidät kyllä sijoitetuksi. Saattaa käydä niin,  että siitä paikasta, joka tänään on A numero 1, ei huomenna voi ottaa  ainoatakaan kalaa.» Condy antoi Blixille sysäyksen, kun heidän opastajansa meni noutamaan  käyntikorttinsa. »Kuulitteko te?» kuiskasi hän. »Ei sanota pyydystää kalaa, vaan ottaa se; se on teknillinen sanonta.» Sitten ostivat he vehkeensä: pari halpaa telaa ja siimoja kielukkeineen  ja kohoineen, valikoiman kärpäsiä rakastettavan kauppa-apulaisen  neuvon mukaan ja pienen, sievän vihreäksi maalatun tinalaatikon, jonka  kannessa oli oivallinen kullattu nieriäinen, suolattuja peltovariksia  sisältävän kulhon lisäksi, joita kärpästen ohella oli käytettävä  varasyöttinä. Peltovarikset piti Blixin ostaa asuntonsa lähellä  olevasta pienestä kalakellarista. »Mutta», sanoi kauppa-apulainen, »teillä pitää olla lupa kalastaa  siinä järvessä. Oletteko te suhteissa vesitoimistoihin? Teillä on ehkä  osakkeita yhtiössä?» Condy vaaleni, ja Blix veti henkeään. He katsoivat toisiinsa. Siinä he  nyt olivat. »Niin, niin», sanoi tämä ylevä olento, joka seisoi paitahihasillaan  tiskin takana, »voittehan nyt koettaa. Ja ellei käy, niin tulkaa vain  minun luokseni; kyllä me teidät jonnekin saamme sijoitetuksi. Mutta  San Andreas-järvi on ollut hyvässä huudossa viime viikkojen kuluessa  — sieltä on otettu muutamia tavattoman suuria lohenmulloja. Olisipa  ikävä, jos ette te pääsisi sinne.» Nyt riippui kaikki tuosta luvasta. Vasta kun koko retkisuunnitelma  huojui, ymmärsivät Condy ja Blix oikein kuinka korkealle he olivat  toiveensa jännittäneet. »Kyllä se onnistuu», sanoi heidän ystävänsä tyynnyttäen. »Olisipa  helkkari, ellette voisi saada sitä sille kortille. Jos saatte  otetuksi oikean lohenmullon, niin ilmoittakaa minulle, niin panen  sen sanomalehteen. Minä toimitan ’Metsästys ja kalastuspalstaa’ The  Pressissä», lisäsi hän niskaansa nykäisten. Iltapäivällä, kun Blix istui kotona suuressa odotuksen jännityksessä,  sai hän Condyltä uuden sähkösanoman: »Tilanne selvä. Rajaton lupa.  Elkää unhoittako peltovariksia!» Oli tarkoitus että Condy tulisi sunnuntai-iltapäivänä sopimaan asiasta  lopullisesti Blixin kanssa. Mutta kävikin niin, että hän näyttäytyi jo  lauantai-iltana. Hän oli istunut kerhon kirjastossa ja kirjoittanut uutta loppua  sukeltajakertomukseensa, ja juuri kun hän oli valmis, tuli Sargeant. »Heipä hei, vanha poika, istutko sinä täällä ihan ypöyksinäsi. Tule  mukaan saamaan savuke. Hendrich ja Hands tulevat tänne tunnin kuluttua.  He pyysivät, että minä koettaisin saada sinut käsiini.» Condy liikahti hermostuneesti tuolilla. Hän ymmärsi mikä tarkoitus oli.  Hänellä oli kyllin rahaa tänä iltana, ja vihamies oli silmänräpäyksessä  valpas. Kannukset kylkeen ja ruoskaa selkään. Siinä seisoi Sargeant,  klubimestari, hyvin säilynyt kolmikymmenvuotias, kieltämättä  hieman kyynikko, mutta sukkela veitikka joka tapauksessa ja Condyn  hyvä ystävä. Mutta sielunsa silmillä näki Condy edessään nuoren,  yhdeksäntoistavuotiaan tytön, puoleksi lapsen, puoleksi naisen; näki  kuinka hyvä hän oli, näki vilaukselta hänen naisellisen hienoutensa,  kauneutensa ja voimansa. »Mihin kelpaa heikon miehen hyvyys?» oli hän  sanonut ja katsonut häneen. »Arvelen, että voimme järjestää pienen pelikunnan täällä tänä iltana»,  ilmoitti Sargeant hyvänsävyisesti hymyillen. Condy puri huultaan. »Minä tulen pian», sanoi hän. »Odota hetkinen».  Hän juoksi portinvartijan luo ja sai lähetetyksi pikaviestin Blixille —  kolmannen sinä päivänä: »Saanko tulla heti? On tärkeä asia. Lähettäkää minulle pari sanaa  tuojan mukana!» Kolmen neljännestunnin kuluttua oli hänellä Blixin vastaus ja hän  juoksi portaita alas samassa kun Hendrich Ja Hands nousivat hissiin. Nyt istui Condy Bessemerin ruokasalin ulkonemassa ja selitti Blixille  minkä tähden hän oli tullut. »Teitte oikein!» sanoi hän. »Te olette aina tervetullut ja milloin  tahansa, kun te — kun te huomaatte sen tarpeelliseksi.» »Toisinaan menen niin pitkälle, Blix», tunnusti hän alakuloisena ja  syvällä itsensähalveksimisella, »että kun en voi saada ketään pelaamaan  kanssani, niin asetun minä pelaamaan kuviteltujen pelitoverien kanssa  ja seurustelen heidän kanssaan saadakseni vain pitää kortteja sormieni  välissä ja kuulla niiden kahisevan. Hyi! Minä häpeän itseäni.» Sunnuntaina tuli Condy illalliselle tapansa mukaan. Illallisen jälkeen,  perheen hajaannuttua ja Victorinen mentyä pois, ryhtyivät he kalaretken  valmistushommiin. Blix täytti eväsvasun; voileipiä, »premie-liikkiötä»,  niinkuin Condy tapasi sanoa, kovaksi keitettyjä munia, oliivimuhennosta  ja pullo punaviiniä. Condy riisui nuttunsa ja askaroi hermostuneesti kalastustarpeiden  kanssa, purki siimat puolista ja keri ne vapoihin, kiinnitti polot  ja sitoi kärpäset kielukkeisiin koko ajan polttaen savukettaan ja  kasvoillaan ylen ankara ilme. Hänen onnistui sotkea siimat, saada  koukut pöytäliinaan, pudottaa melkein näkymättömät silkkirihmat  lattialle ja kiinnittää polot kielukkeisiin, sen sijaan että olisi  kiinnittänyt ne siimoihin. Lopulta täytyi hänen pyytää Blixiä avuksi;  tämä selvitti siimat kärsivällisyydellä, joka tuntui Condystä melkein  yliluonnolliselta. Kello yhdeksän ajoissa kysyi tyttö häneltä painokkaasti: »Tiedättekö  kuinka varhain meidän on noustava ylös, jos mielimme saada kahvia ja  ehtiä seitsemän junalla? Viimeistään neljännestä vailla kuusi; ja  teidän täytyy nousta vielä varemmin, sillä teillä on pitempi matka.  Te voitte kernaasti tulla tänne ja murkinoida — mutta — kuuletteko te  — kuuletteko ollenkaan? — teidän on oltava täällä puoli seitsemältä. Kuuletteko , Condy? Sitten menemme yhdessä asemalle. Elkää vain  unhottako ottaa vapoja mukaan!» »Minä pukeudun pyöräilypukuuni!» selitti Condy, »ja otan sellaisen  kaulaliinan kuin golfpelaajat pitävät.» »Ei», selitti Blix, »sitä en tahdo. Teidän on pukeuduttava huonoimpiin  vaatteisiinne, mutta pitäkää sentään huoli siitä, että näytätte  jotakuinkin arvokkaalta. Mehän aiomme mennä paluumatkalla Lunaan,  ettekö muista. Ja menkää nyt kotiin ja pankaa levolle. Ei ole liian  varhaista, kun teidän on noustava kello kuusi.» Condy ei tullut liian myöhään seuraavana aamuna, niinkuin Blix oli  pelännyt. Hän tuli päinvastoin aivan naurettavan liian varhain.  Merkillistä kyllä oli hän muistanut ottaa ongenvavat mukaansa, mutta  hän värisi hermostuneena. Syödä hän ei voinut». »Me myöhästymme junasta», selitti hän joka hetki. »Olen aivan varma  siitä, että me myöhästymme. Katsokaa kelloa, Blix! Nyt meidän pitäisi  jo olla matkalla. Tulkaa nyt. Ette te tarvitse enempää kahvia. Onko  teillä kaikki mukana? Ovatko kääröt korissa? Hyvä! Entä kärpäset, Blix!  Voi kauhistus, jos te unohdatte kärpäset.» Hätäilemisellään sai hän Blixin asemalle puoli tuntia liian varhain. Juna ei vielä ollut esillä ja pilettiluukku oli suljettu. »Sitähän minä sanoin, Condy», huokasi Blix ja vaipui istumaan  odotussalin penkille. »Enkö sitä sanonut?» »Ei», vastasi hän suoraan ilmaan ja katseli hermostuneesti ympärilleen.  »Me emme ole tulleet hituistakaan liian varhain — nyt voimme olla  hiukan levollisia. Haluaisin tietää miltä asemasillalta tuo juna  lähtee. Haluaisin tietää pysähtyykö se San Brunolla. Kuinka pitkä matka  mahtaa olla San Brunolta San Andreas-järvelle? Kunhan ei vain alkaisi  sataa, Blix. — Olemme unohtaneet peltovarikset!!» »Ei, sitä me emme ole . Istukaahan nyt. Tässä peltovarikset ovat. Kohta minä alan ulista hermostumisesta, Condy. Te aivan tuhoatte minut.» Kolme neljännestä sen jälkeen oli juna vienyt heidät San Brunoon, joka  ei ollut muuta kuin maantiemajatalo, jossa kaupunkilaiset, jotka olivat  tulleet sorsia ampumaan ja huvikseen kalastamaan, pitivät päämajaansa.  Tänään oli se kuitenkin Blixin ja Condyn hoteissa kokonaan. Ja kaikki  ihmiset olivat tänään niin tavattoman herttaisia. Vieläpä tuo korkea  herrakin pilettiluukulla San Franciscossa oli alentunut toivottamaan  heille hyvää kalaonnea. Junailija oli ollut ylen suopea. Junan  kuljettaja oli omassa korkeassa persoonassaan tullut heidän luokseen,  jotta he viittä minuuttia varemmin saisivat tietää, että heidän  seuraavalla asemalla oli mentävä junasta. Ja San Brunossa valjasti  isäntä itse hevosen ja kyyditsi heidät järvelle luvaten vielä tulla  noutamaankin heidät Richardsonilta hyvissä ajoin ennen iltajunan lähtöä. »Ja hän pyysi vain puoli dollaria molemmilta retkiltä», kuiskasi Condy Blixille heidän ajaa vieriessä eteenpäin. Seutu oli ihana. Kello oli tuskin kahdeksaa vielä, eikä ilma ollut  vielä menettänyt ensimmäisen sarastuksen eloisaa raikkautta. Molemmin  puolin tietä kohosi maisema paljaiden, harmaanvihreiden, harvasti  tammipuita kasvavien mäki-rinteiden muodostamina pitkähköinä aaltoina  vaaleansinisen taivaan alla. Tuntui karjan hajua, ja pari kertaa  kuulivat he näkymättömän leivosen livertelevän yläilmoissa. Kaikkialla  vallitsi hiljaisuus. Vanhoissa kevytkieseissä ja ripeässä hevosessa  oli viehättävä tallin ja silojen haju; ja silloin tällöin tuntui makea  ruohon ja lehtien tuoksu. Oli verrattoman ihanaa saada siemaista  keuhkoihinsa tämän raikkaan ja rauhallisen aamun ilmaa. Heidän nuoret  sydämensä aivan hypähtelivät. Blixin posket punastuivat, ja hänen  pienet, tummanruskeat silmänsä aivan kuin säkenöivät tyytyväisyyttä. »Täälläpä vasta on kaunista, Condy», huudahti hän. »Niin, tuntuupa  melkein kuin kasvaisin», selitti hän totisena. »Voisinpa nostaa  maailman tällaisena aamuna.» Sitten tulivat he järven rannalle ja löysivät Richardsonin talon,  hänen, jolle kuului järven valvonta. Reipas hevonen lönkytti taas  kotiin, ja Blix ja Condy kävivät nyt käsiksi juhlan vakavaan puoleen.  Ei ollut laisinkaan tarpeellista näyttää Richardsonille myymälän  rakastettavan kauppa-apulaisen antamaa korttia. Vanha yankee, jonka  rohkea ja kuiva huumori muodosti omituisen vastakohdan tälle juhlivalle  aamuhetkelle, oli itse personoitu huolenpitäväisyys. Hän valitsi  heille parhaimman venheen, lainasi heille oman ankkurinsa — kappaleen  rautatiekiskoa — osotti heille tarkasti sen kohdan vastaisella  rannalla, josta viimeksi oli »otettu» suuri lohi, ja hän meni polvia  myöten veteen voidakseen oikein työntää veneen vesille. Condy tarttui airoihin. Blix istahti perätuhdolle ja alkoi järjestää  ongenvapoja ja kiinnittää siimoja. Hän pani omin käsin syötit  koukkuihin — suolatuista peltovariksista — ja yhdeksän ajoissa olivat  he jo ankkuroineet eräälle paikalle noin 24 jalkaa maasta ja kalastivat  Richardsonin neuvoa noudattaen »vähän ulompana kaislikon reunaa.» »Vaikkapa ei kertaakaan nykäisisi», sanoi Condy ja antoi siiman liukua,  »niin voimme varsin oivallisesti huvitella. Katsokaa vain» — hän  viittasi kädellään — »eikö täällä ole suurenmoista?» He olivat aivan yksin. Oli vielä varhainen aamupäivä. Järvi leveni länteen ja etelään, eikä sen sileällä silkinharmaalla  pinnalla näkynyt pienintäkään väreilyä. Vain idässä, jossa aurinko  juuri pilkisti esiin jotenkin korkean harjun olan takaa, leimahteli  se häikäisevässä timanttivälkkeessä. Ylt'ympäri veden ja taivaan  välillä oli maa vaipunut sunnuntailepoon. Kaukana ’Richardsonin talon  tuolla puolen kuului koira haukkuvan. Ääni kantautui niin heikkona ja  hentona heille. Silloin tällöin kohoutui vene hiljalleen ja hillitysti  loiskahtaen. Lähimmän rannan tiheissä lumimarjapensasviidakoissa  kutsuivat ja maanittelivat räkättirastaat niin ystävällisesti toisiaan;  keltainen perhonen leijaili yksikseen eksyneenä heidän yllään, ja  hoikat siniset sudenkorennot tulivat ja istahtivat heidän siimoilleen  ja vavoilleen ja taivuttivat ruumiinsa takapuolen ylöspäin. Paikaltaan keulasta katseli Condy Blixiä. Hän istui pidellen molemmin  käsin ongenvapaa, hän oli kokonaan kiintynyt pitämään silmällä kohoa.  Huolimatta vanhasta leningistä, johon hän tätä retkeä varten oli  pukeutunut, oli hän yhtä sorea kuin ennenkin. Hänen pyöreä, voimakas  kaulansa oli nytkin kiedottu johonkin pehmeään valkoiseen, ja suuri  koiran kaulanauha kiersi tiiviisti hänen voimakasta vyötäystään.  Keltaiset hiukset saarsivat ilmavana säteikkönä valkoista otsaa ja  vienosti rusottavia poskia, ja kolmannenkymmenennen kerran ihaili Condy  ruskeita silmiä vaikuttavana vastakohtana valkoiselle silkkinauhalle,  keltaisille hiuksille, valkoiselle hipiälle ja poskien hienolle rusolle. Kului tunti. Kului toinen. »Täällä ei ole kaloja», mumisi Condy ja veti siiman ylös katsoakseen  syöttiä. Mutta hänen siinä askaroidessaan kärpästen kanssa huudahti  Blix äkkiä: »Minun — käy — onkeen — Condy!» Condy katsoi ylös; Blixin ongenvavassa tuntui tempaus; vielä kerran  ja sitten taas kerran. Sitten taipui vapa äkkiä, tela pyöri, siima  pingottui ja viilsi suoraan läpi veden. »Nyt te saatte sen! Nyt te saatte sen!» huusi Condy vavisten kiihkosta. »Se on komea lohi!» Blix nousi ja kääri siimaa telalle minkä kerkesi, tempovan ja tanssivan  vavan, pää painettuna vyötä vasten. Äkkiä oikeni vapa taas ikäänkuin  vapautuneena kovasta puristuksesta, ja siima liukui äkkiä yhä  loitommaksi venheestä. »Se pääsi irti!» huusi Blix. »Oletteko mieletön? Nyt se hyppää. Pitäkää varanne!» Ja nyt olivat he molemmat jännityksestä vavisten todistajina  lohenmullon mitä piristyttävimpiin hyppäyksiin. Läpi kupla- ja  vaahtopilven hyppäsi se sinisestä vedestä ylös harmaaseen ilmaan  säteilevin suomuksin ja levitetyin evin, siinä oli hopeanhohdetta,  käyräsapelin välähdystä läpi harmaan usvan ja loisketta ja kohinaa,  levottomien äänten surinaa, joka äkkiä rikkoi näiden tiimojen  rauhallisen levon. »Pitäkää nyt varanne!» kuiskasi Condy yhteen puristettujen hampaiden  välistä. »Kerikää nopeasti telalle, kun se lähenee, ja antakaa liukua,  kun se tekee liian voimakasta vastarintaa.» Blix hengitti kiivaasti, hänen poskensa hehkuivat, hänen silmänsä  säkenöivät. »Ooh», huohotti hän, »minä niin pelkään, että se pääsee minulta  karkuun. Katsokaa nyt!» huusi hän, kun lohenmullo lähti kiitämään kohti  pohjaa ja taivutti vapaa, niin että sen kärki joutui veden alle. »Se  pääsee minulta irti, Condy! Olen varma siitä. Ottakaa te mieluummin  tämä vapa.» »En hinnalla millään! Olkaa vain rauhallinen! No, se on taas poissa. Tämä vasta on urheilua . Metrin toisensa jälkeen keri Blix siimaa telalle, kunnes he näkivät  vilahdukselta lohenmullon sivut vihreän veden läpi. Hän veti sen  lähemmä. Nyt se näkyi selvään, ui yhdensuuntaisesti veneen kanssa.  Suu oli sepposen seljällään, koukku kärpäsineen oli tarttunut sen  alaleukaan; he näkivät pyrstöevän punaiset, väräjävät hetaleet. Kala  oli hiukan litteä sivuilta, vatsa lumivalkoinen. Se oli melkein niin  pitkä kuin Condyn kyynärvarsi. »Onpa se kaunis! Eikö olekin?» muniisi Condy. »Olkaa nyt oikein  varovainen. Vetäkää se veneen laitaan, niin että minä yletyn siihen.  Hyvin varovaisesti, Blix. Jos se rimpuilee, niin antakaa siiman liukua.» Kaksi kertaa ponnahti lohenmullo loitommaksi venheen varjon  pelästyttämänä ja kaksi kertaa lauloi ja surisi pyörä niinkuin  kalistin, kun Blix heitti siiman höllälle. Mutta kolmannen kerran  tuli se pinnalle ja kääntyi hitaasti kyljelleen, valkoinen vatsa ja  punainen evä vedessä. Sen kidukset aukenivat ja sulkeutuivat Se oli  väsynyt. Ja kolmannen kerran veti Blix sen varovaisesti laitaa vasten.  Condy kumartui ja työnsi käsivartensa veteen hartiata myöten, tarttui  kahdella sormella levitettyihin kiduksiin ja heilahdutti sen venheeseen. Heidän ihastuksensa oli aivan lapsellista. Condy hoilasi kuin intiaani  ja heilutti hattua ilmassa. Blix sai tuskin sanaa suustaan. Hän seisoi  hiukset hajalla ja kädet nyrkissä ja sai kyyneleet silmiinsä pelkästä  lauenneesta jännityksestä. He puristivat toistensa käsiä; he puhuivat  hurjasti toistensa suuhun; he rummuttivat istuimia; he nauroivat omaa  hullutustaan; he katselivat lohenmulloa joka puolelta, koettivat arvata  sen painoa ja muistuttivat toisilleen taistelun yksityiskohtia. »Eikö ollutkin suurenmoinen näky, kun se hyppäsi yli vedenpinnan?» »Kyllä. Entä kun minä huomasin, että onkeeni kävi! Se tuli niin  arvaamatta; minä melkein pelästyin. En ole ikipäivinäni ennen ollut  niin onnellinen», huudahti Blix, »kuin juuri sillä hetkellä. Niin,  ajatelkaas, Condy, että kävi hyvin!» »Eikö olekin huiman eriskummallista?» »Kyllä, tämä on parempaa kuin viisi o’clock-tee-kutsua, tanssiaisia ja  päivällistä, eikö olekin?» »Kuulkaapas, Blix, kuinka vanhoja me oikeastaan olemme?» »Samantekevä kuinka vanhoja me olemme, mutta olenpa varma siitä, että  lohenmullo painaa kaksi leiviskää.» Kun he vihdoinkin olivat tyyntyneet, jatkoivat he taas kalastamista.  Ennenkun he osasivat arvatakaan, oli kello jo kaksitoista. Puoli yhden  ajoissa oli Blix saanut kolme lohenmulloa, mutta ne olivat pienempiä  kuin ensimmäinen. Condyn onkea ei ollut kertaakaan nykäissyt. Kello  yksi soutivat he maihin ja söivät aamiaista tuuhean tammen suojassa  pienessä lumimarjapensaista muodostetussa pyöröteatterissa. Ei milloinkaan ollut ateria maistunut niin herkulliselta. Mitä sillä  väliä, vaikka viini oli laimeaa ja keitetyt oliivit härskiintyneitä!  Vähätpä siitä, että koviksi keitetyille munille varattu suola oli  levinnyt yli »premie-liikkiön»? Ja että munat olivat liian vähän  kiehuneet ja että he olivat unhottaneet korkkiruuvin? He eivät  voineet muuta kuin tuntea olevansa seitsemännessä taivaassa ilosta ja  reippaudesta. Vain todellinen onnettomuus olisi voinut pilata heidän  hyvän tuulensa. Mutta kun he olivat lopettaneet aterian ja Blix oli pakannut haarukat  ja lusikat, sanoi hän Condylle, joka makasi seljällään ja tupsuutteli  sikariaan: »No, Condy, mitä arvelette, emmekö pelaa pientä erää korttia?» Condy hukkasi sikaarin, hyppäsi ylös ja harjasi kuivat lehdet  kaulastaan. Blix oli ottanut korttipakan mukaan ja neljä rullaa  silkkipaperiin käärittyjä markkoja. Condy tuijotti häneen  hämmästyksestä sanattomana. »Emmekö?» toisti hän hymyillen ja katsoi häneen. »Mutta Blix!» huudahti hän, yhä yhtä ihmeissään. »Mitä te tarkoitatte?» »Minä tarkoitan mitä sanon. Minä haluaisin kernaasti pelata pienen erän  teidän kanssanne.» »Ei, kiitoksia», epäsi hän melkein kylmästi. »Kuulkaahan nyt, Condy», alkoi Blix. Ja huolimatta hänen voimakkaista  vastaväitteistään ja selityksistään ja kissaviekööstään piti hän  hänelle mitä suurimmalla tyyneydellä viisi minuuttia kestävän esitelmän. »Minä en pyydä, että teidän on lakattava pelaamasta», sanoi hän  lopuksi, »minä pyydän vain, jos se teitä tyydyttää, kun te huomaatte,  että olette pakoitettu siihen — kun ette voi olla sitä tekemättä,  tarkoitan — että te tulette ja pelaatte minun kanssani sen sijaan että  menisitte klubiin pelaamaan.» »Mutta sehän on järjetöntä, sehän on aivan suunnatonta. Minua inhottaa  nähdä nuorten tyttöjen pelaavan hasardipeliä — saati sitten teidän ! »Ei suinkaan se ole minulle pahempaa kuin teille — ja keiden muiden  kanssa luulette, että minä petaisin? Mutta te luulette kai, että minä  pelaan niin huonosti, ettei teillä voi olla siitä mitään huvia?» sanoi  hän hilpeästi. »Sekö siinä on esteenä? Mutta siinäpä erehdytte; saatte  sen pian nähdä. Kyllä minä pelata osaan — olinpa sitten oppinut sen  miten tahansa?» »Niin — mutta, Blix. Te ette tiedä kuinka usein me pelaamme, minä ja ne  muut. Melkeinpä joka… te ette tiedä kuinka usein me korttia lyömme.» »Condy — milloin tahansa, kun te vain haluatte pelata korttia ja  tahdotte pelata minun kanssani, heitän minä kaiken muun sikseen ja  olen heti valmis.» »Mutta minkä tähden?» »Sentähden, että luulen, että ehkä te siten pelaisitte harvemmin ja  vähitellen, ehkä — mutta sitä en nyt huoli ajatella. Minä haluan  pelata; tyytykää nyt siihen. Mutta luvatkaa, että ette petaa kenenkään  muun kanssa — sanotaanpa puoleen vuoteen.» Asia päättyi siihen, että Condy häpesi ja antoi hänelle sanansa. »Pyh!» pilkkasi Condy, »mistäpä te pookeria osaisitte? Parasta lienee,  että pelaamme mustaa pekkaa tai kasinoa.» Blix oli antanut ja jakanut pelirahat. »Saattoseurueita ja valtteja pyydetään heti », ilmoitti hän  kylmäverisesti. Se sattui Condyyn kuin pistos. Sitten vilkasi hän syrjäsilmällä häneen  ja otti korttinsa. »Teidän on alotettava.» »Minä panen viisi.» »Viisikö? Hyvä! Kuinka monta korttia?» »Minä otan kaksi.» »Minä panen viisi lisää.» Blix silmäili korttejaan. Sitten sanoi hän yhtä kylmäverisesti kuin  äskenkin: »Viisi yhden lisäksi. Niinpä panen viisi.» »Viisi parempaa.» »Ja viisi parempaa taas.» »Nakatkaa!» »Täysi käsi. Ässiä ja kymppejä», sanoi Blix ja järjesti korttinsa. »Nepä vasta kortit!» mumisi Condy, kun Blix kokosi pelimarkkojaan. Tuntia myöhemmin oli Blix voittanut koko Condyn kassan, lähemmä viisi  dollaria. »Nyt taukoamme ja menemme taas kalastamaan; teemmekö niin.» Condy suostui ja Blix laski voittonsa. »Te olette minulle velkaa seitsemän ja puoli dollaria, Condy.» Condy hymyili. »Hyvä», sanoi hän leikillisesti, »minä lähetän teille sille summalle  asetetun shekin.» Mutta sen pani Blix kovin pahakseen. »Niin ette kohtelisi ketään ystävistänne klubissa!» huudahti hän.  »Niin ette sanoisi heille, ja niinpä ei ole oikein, että sanotte niin  minulle. Antakaapa tänne nyt ne seitsemän ja puoli dollaria, Condy.  Teidän ei pidä pelata toisella tavalla minun kanssani kuin muiden. Minä  olisin kyllä maksanut teille, jos olisin menettänyt.» »Niin, mutta minulla on vain yhdeksän dollaria. Kuka sitten suorittaa  paluupiletit ja illallisen Lunassa?» »Sen teen minä.» »Niin, mutta — minulla ei ole varaa menettää noita rahoja.» »Sitten ei teidän olisi pitänyt antautua pelaamaan. Teillä oli samat  mahdollisuudet kuin minullakin. Saanko rahani, Condy?» »Te suorastaan nylette minut.» »Saanko minä rahani, vai enkö niitä saa?» »No, ottakaa ne sitten!» Blix pisti rahat kukkaroonsa, nousi ylös ja harjasi hameensa. »Niin, niin», sanoi hän, »kun nyt olemme suoriutuneet huvista,  nimittäin korttipelistä, niin ryhtykäämme siis taas totisiin  tehtäviimme, nimittäin pyytämään, ei — 'ottamaan' kaikki järvessä  olevat lohenmullot.» Kun kello oli viisi, veti Condy ylös kiskonkappaleen ja souti järven  yli takaisin Richardsonin taloon. Blix saattoi merkitä muistiin kuusi  lohenmulloa, mutta Condyllä oli ollut ihan naurettavan huono onni. »Voin varsin hyvin seisoa ongenvapa kädessä niin kauan kuin kuka  tahansa, mutta minä tahtoisin niin vietävän mielelläni saada  tilaisuuden vaihtaa täkyä ainakin kerran toisinaan. Minun onkeani ei  ole kertaakaan nykäisty, ei koko päivänä edes kertaakaan hipaistu.  No, olipa hyvä, että te saitte tuon suuren lohenmullon, Blix, sen  ensimmäisen, tarkoitan. Noiden viiden minuutin takia kannatti jo tehdä  tämä retki. Mutta kaikki tyyni on onnistunut hyvin. Tänne tulemme tästä  lähin kerran viikossa.» Ja sitten oli heillä vielä, juuri kun he astuivat maihin Richardsonin  talon kohdalla, pieni seikkailu, joka aivan kuin kruunasi koko päivän.  Kahden kiven välisessä lätäkössä näkivät he pienen, kirjavan käärmeen,  joka ei juuri ollut lyijykynää paksumpi, ja se yritti juuri paraillaan  niellä pientä viheriäistä sammakkoa. Sillä oli siitä hirveä vaiva;  he seisoivat ainakin kymmenen minuuttia ja nauttivat jännittävästä  pienestä näytelmästä, joka kuitenkin päättyi onnellisesti uhrin pakoon  ja hyveen voittoon. »Sitä me juuri tarvitsimme», sanoi Blix, kun he kömpivät ylös vanhoihin  kääseihin ajaakseen asemalle. »Se teki päivän täydelliseksi.» He saapuivat kaupunkiin hämärissä ja lähettivät kalansa, ongenvapansa  ja muut vehkeensä kotiin Bessemerille pikalähetillä, joka samalla vei  pari selittävää riviä Blixiltä hänen isälleen. »Nyt kiireimmiten Lunalle ja avioliittosuunnitelmiimme», sanoi Condy. VII. Lunan meksikolaisella ravintolalla ei ole mitään osoitetta. Se ei  sijaitse minkään vissin kadun varrella, eikä missään erityisessä  kulmassa. Eivätpä edes päävieraat voineet antaa tietoa sen paikasta,  kun sitä heiltä kysyi. Se on vain »tuolla toisella puolella», »ei  varsin kaukana tuomiokirkosta, tiedättehän.» Jos menee sitä etsimään,  niin saattaa sen löytää, mutta aivan mahdotonta on opastaa sinne  muita. Sinne voi tulla kiinalaiskaupungin kautta. Viimeiseltä  ahtaalta kadulta, jossa katunaiset oleilevat, tullaan meksikolaisen  kaupunginosan laidalle, ja kun sitten käy suoraan sinne minne nenä  osoittaa yhtä tai kahta katua, alati tiukasti tähystäen molemmin  puolin, niin ei voi välttyä tulemasta suoraan Lunaan. Se on paikka,  jota täytyy etsiä, mutta jonka aina löytää. Tänä maanantai-iltana saapuivat Blix ja Condy Lunaan neljännestä vailla  seitsemän. Condy oli eksynyt. He olivat otattaneet kummallisimpia  katuja ylös ja alas ja olivat aivan epätoivon partaalla, kun Blix äkkiä  huomasi kilven lähimmässä kulmassa. Niinkuin Condy oli ennustanutkin, saivat he koko ravintolan  käytettäväkseen. He sijoittuivat sisähuoneeseen, jossa oli peili ja  kuusi tuolia ja komeat valkoisesta akutinkankaasta tehdyt oviverhot,  ja isäntä, joka noudatti nimeä Richard tai Riccardo, miten milloinkin  soveltui, alkoi tarjoilla »meksikkolaista illallista» juhlallisen menon  mukaan. Syödessään pitivät he koko ajan ovea silmällä, ja kun pavut  tulivat pöydälle, hätkähtivät molemmat ja vaihtoivat nopean katseen. Jotensakin vauhdikkaasti astui sisään mies, jonka takin rintapielessä  oli kaksi vuohensilmäkukkaa, ja asettui lähimmän pöydän ääreen. Condy ähkyi hillitystä jännityksestä. »Se on hän», kuiskasi hän, »se on kapteeni Jack!» He tarkastivat salavihkaa vasta tullutta vierasta ja sopivat siitä,  että hän oli pettymys. Ollakseen ent. merikapteeni oli hän tavattoman  arkipäiväisen näköinen. Hän oli punatukkainen, oli nuorempi kuin he  olivat luulleet ja mikä pahinta, hän oli auttamattomasti halpa. »Poloinen K.D.B.!» huokasi Blix ja pudisti päätään. »Pelkäänpä, ettei  siitä tule mitään hänen kanssaan. Mutta onhan mahdollista, että hän  on parempi kuin miltä näyttää. Saattaa sattua, että punatukkaisilla  ihmisillä on hyvä sydän.» »Ne ovat tunneihmisiä», sinkahutti Condy. Samassa tuli vielä toinen mies sisälle. Hänkin istahti erään lähellä  olevan pöydän ääreen. Hänkin tilasi »meksikkolaisen illallisen.»  Hänelläkin oli nutun rintamuksessa vuohensilmäkukkanen. »Kuolema ja helvetti», läähätti Condy kalveten. Blix vaipui avuttomana  kokoon kädet helmassa. He tuijottivat vallan hämillään toisiaan. »Sepä oli hieno juttu», sanoi Condy ja kävi muka kiireesti käsiksi  curryyn, joka hänellä oli edessään. Mutta Blix työnsi lautasen sivulle. »Mikä on tarkoitus?» kuiskasi Condy yli pöydän. »Mikä tarkoitus taivaan  nimessä on tällä?» »On vain yksi mahdollinen selitys», sanoi Blix. »Toinen miehistä  on kapteeni ja toinen on vain satunnaisuus. Kuka tahansa voi käydä  vuohensilmäkukka napinlävessä. Se meidän olisi pitänyt ottaa huomioon.» »Niin, ajatelkaas, jos nyt K.D.B. tulee!» »Vastatullut muistuttaa ulkonäöltään enin kapteenia.» Tämä oli  lyhyenläntä, leveähartiainen, neljänkymmenen korvilla oleva mies;  hänellä oli pienet, harmahtavat viikset, ja hänessä oli todellakin  jotakin »raitista ja työteliästä». Mutta mitään ratkaisevaa eroitusta  ei näillä kahdella ollut; punatukkainen saattoi varsin hyvin olla  entinen kapteeni, ja hän oli varmasti yli kolmenkymmenen viiden. »Kumpi heistä se on? Millä ihmeen tavalla saamme sen selville? Kun  vain jollakin lailla saisimme tietää kumpi heistä on tilapäinen,  voisimme ehkä myöskin keksiä keinon miten pääsisimme hänestä eroon. Sen  olemme velkaa K.D.B:lle, Condy. Se on aivan yksinkertaisesti meidän  velvollisuutemme. Meidän alotteestamme on hän täällä tai tulossa tänne,  meidän tulee vointimme mukaan häntä auttaa. Ja hän voi tulla milloin  tahansa. Paljonko kello on?» »Viisi minuuttia yli seitsemän. Mutta luulisinpä, että oikea —  kapteeni — tulisi hyvin hämilleen, jos hän näkisi toisen kavaljeerin  vuohensilmäkukkineen. Mutta katsokaas, näyttääkö kumpikaan heistä  olevan hämillään? Ei laisinkaan; mitä? Kapteeni katsoa mulkoilisi hieman kilpailijaansa, luulisin.» He katselivat taas pitkän aikaa salavihkaa miehiä. »Ei», sanoi Blix hiljaa, »sitä ei voi sanoa. Kumpikaan heistä ei juuri  mulkoile. Mutta kuulkaahan, Condy» — kuiskasi hän — »punatukkaisen  hattu on tuolilla hänen takanaan sisäpuoli ylöspäin. Ettekö voisi  nousta katsomaan mitä siinä on luettavana?» »Mitä se hyödyttäisi?» »Kyllä, saisi tietää hänen nimikirjaimensa, tarkoitan. Tai ehkäpä koko  hänen nimensä; se saattaa varsin hyvin olla hatussa. Ainakin voitte  katsoa, onko sinne merkitty ’kapteeni’.» Condy nousi, oli noutavinaan tulitikun naapuripöydällä olevasta  rikotusta ja kiinnikitatusta porsliinialustasta ja sai samalla  tilaisuuden tutkia hattua sisältä päin. Blix saattoi tuskin hengittää  jännitykseltä. Sitten tuli Condy takaisin ja istuutui. »Vain nimikirjaimet», kuiskasi hän, »W.A.J.» J:hän voi vallan hyvin  merkitä Jack, mutta se voi myöskin merkitä Johan tai Jeremias tai  Josua, ja hän voipi reilusti olla kapteeni, vaikka ei sitä hatussa ole  mainittu. Olemme yhä yhtä viisaita.» »Ja K.D.B. voi tulla millä hetkellä tahansa. Hän on ehkä jo ollutkin  täällä ja kurkistanut ikkunasta sisään, ja sitten on hän mennyt pois,  kun näki kaksi miestä, joilla kummallakin oli vuohensilmäkukkanen  napinlävessä. Se olisi hänen tapaistaan. Mitä meidän on tehtävä?» »Odottakaapa hiukan», mumisi Condy. »Minulla on keino. Minä kyllä saan  selville kapteenin. Voitteko nähdä tuon taulun seinällä?» Blix seurasi hänen katseensa suuntaa. Taulu oli oivallinen värillinen  kivipiirros, joka esitti täysin purjein smaragdinvihreitä aaltoja  halkovaa luotsilaivaa. »Tuotako kuunaria te tarkoitatte?» kysyi Blix. »Sitä juuri, tuota kuunaria. Mutta kuulkaahan nyt. Te kysytte minulta  kovalla äänellä, mikä laiva se on, ja kun minä vastaan, pidätte te  silmällä kumpaakin miestä.» »Minkä tähden? Mitä teillä on mielessä?» »Se kyllä käy ilmi. Tehkää nyt niinkuin sanon. Meillä ei ole aikaa  hukata.» Blix kumartui hiukan taapäin ja yskäsi. Sitten sanoi hän: »Tuollapa on  kaunis laiva seinällä! Näettekö sen? Eikö se ole soma? Mutta voitteko  te sanoa minulle minkä lajin laivoja se on?» Condy kääntyi ympäri ja katsoi laivaa tuntijan ilmeellä. Sitten sanoi hän varmasti: »Se on soima.» Condyn ei tarvinnut odottaa Blixin merkinantoa. Asia oli  silmänräpäyksessä selvä. Hänen kovalla äänellä annettuaan vastauksensa  heitti punatukkainen vain pikaisen silmäyksen kivipiirrokseen ja jatkoi  taas enchellados’taan. Mutta tummapartainen seurasi Condyn katsetta,  tarkasti taulua ja nauroi pilkallisesti. Kuulivatpa he hänen vielä  mumisevan partaansa: »Itse te voitte olla soima!» »Siinä on kapteeni», kuiskasi Condy, niin pian kuin toinen kääntyi pois  katsottuaan häntä ensin musertavan halveksivasti. Heillä oli vaikea hillitä iloisuuttaan, mutta he kävivät heti taas  totisiksi, kun Blix potkasi Condya pöydän alla ja mumisi: »Nyt katsoo hän kelloaan, kapteeni, K.D.B. ei ole vielä täällä, mutta  punatukkainen häiritsijä on yhä jälellä. Meidän pitää toimittaa hänet  tieltä pois. Keksikää jotakin!» »Mitäpä sitten? Voitte olla varma siitä, ettei hän mene ennenkun on  ateriansa päättänyt. Jos hän istuu täällä, kun K.D.B. tulee, niin on  kaikki menetetty. K.D.B. menee heti. Hän ei edes tule sisälle.» »Niin, se on hirveätä. Sellainen pettymys. Ja minä olin niin iloinnut  siitä, että saisin viedä ne molemmat yhteen. Ja kapteeni Jack on  todellakin hieno mies.» »Sen voi nähdä puolella silmällä», kuiskasi Condy. »Toinen on oikea  turilas.» »Niin, hän on kuin mikäkin kuritushuonekokelas. Hän joutuu kyllä sinne  ennemmin tai myöhemmin.» »Niin, hänellä jo ehkä onkin joku konnantyö tekeillä; eipä sitä  niin tarkkaan tiedä. Tämä meksikkolaisneliö on juuri sopiva paikka  sellaisille asioimisille. Lyönpä vetoa, että hän tietää, missä hän voi  miehiään tavata.» »Ehkäpä. Mutta tuolla hän yhä vain istuu, ja se on pahinta mitä hän  tällä hetkellä voi tehdä. Hän häiritsee noiden molempain kohtausta, hän  tuhoaa kokonaisen romaanin. Ehkä tekee hän ne molemmat onnettomiksi  koko elämän ajaksi. Se on hyvin luultavaa. Ajatelkaa, että voisi käydä  niin. Tämäpä on melkein katastroofi.» » Emmekö sitten voi päästä hänestä?» »Kyllä», kuiskasi Blix äkkiä ja värisi mielenliikutuksesta. »On yksi keino, jos vain uskallamme. Se auttaisi, ja vaikkapa se ei auttaisi,  niin ei hän kuitenkaan koskaan saa tietää mitä me olemme tehneet, eikä  voi meitä edes epäillä. Ooh, mutta me emme uskalla.» »Mitä herran nimessä te ajattelette, Blix?» »Ei, se ei käy. Me emme voi sitä tehdä. Mutta se voisi — — —» »K.D.B. voi tulla tuosta ovesta sisälle millä sekunnilla tahansa.» »Minä en melkein uskalla, mutta… lainatkaa minulle lyijykynä, Condy.»  Hän kirjoitti pari riviä ruokalistan selkäpuolelle, hänen kätensä  vapisi kuin haavanlehti, kun hän ojensi hänelle kirjoituksensa. »Lähettäkää punatukkaiselle tämä sähkösanoma. Pari taloa täältä on  lennätinkonttori, värikaupan vieressä. Huomasin sen, kun tulimme tänne.  Hatussahan näitte hänen nimikirjaimensa: W.J.A., Lunan ravintola, se  riittää.» »No sepä vasta», mumisi Condy, kun hän näki mitä Blix oli kirjoittanut. »Uskallatteko?» kysyi Blix vähän hermostuneesti väristen. »Kyllä, vaikkapa ei siitä mitään tulosta olisikaan — emme siltä joudu  vaaralle alttiiksi.» »Ja K.D.B. tulee joka minuutti lähemmäksi.» »Mutta meneekö hän? Meneekö hän heti? Siinä kysymys.» »Sitä kannattaa koettaa. Parin minuutin kuluttua olette täällä taas. Niin kauan uskallan vallan hyvin olla yksin täällä. Kiiruhtakaa, Condy! Tahdotteko mennä vai ettekö tahdo?» Condy otti hattunsa. »Antakaa minulle vähän rahaa», sanoi hän, »te voititte kaikki mitä  minulla oli.» Pari minuuttia myöhemmin palasi hän takaisin. He istuivat ja toukkivat  vihanneksiaan sydän kurkussa, eivätkä uskaltaneet katsoakaan ylös  lautasilta. Condy oli jännityksestä melkein kipeä ja oli vähällä lyödä  kumoon sifonin, kun sähkösanoman tuoja astui etuhuoneeseen. Hän ja  isäntä keskustelivat hiljaa pöydänteen yli. Sitten sukelsi Richard  valkoisten uudin-oviverhojen välitse sähkösanoma kädessä ja sen tuojan  seuratessa hänen kantapäillään. Hän tunsi nähtävästi punatukkaisen, sillä hän ohjasi suoraan hänen  luokseen ja sanoi: »Arvatenkin teille, herra Atkins?» Hän ojensi hänelle sähkösanoman ja vetäytyi takaisin. Punatukkainen  allekirjoitti kuitin; tuoja meni. Blix ja Condy kuuli paperia revittävän; nyt aukaisi punatukkainen  sähkösanoman. Kului kymmenen sekuntia, kului viisitoista, kului kaksikymmentä. Oli  aivan hiljaista. Condy uskalsi salavihkaa vilkaista punatukkaisen  kuvaa peilissä. Tämä tutki sähkösanomaa rypistetyin otsin. Hän pisti  sen taskuunsa ja kiskaisi sen taas kiivaasti sieltä. Hän unohti  »meksikkolaisen illallisensa» ja hengitti raskaasti. Hän oli suuresti  järkytetty; sen huomasi varsin hyvin. Äkkiä näytti hänet valtaavan  ilkeä tuska. Hän nousi ylös, otti hattunsa, painoi sen silmilleen,  lennätti puoli dollaria pöydälle ja meni pitkin askelin ulos  ravintolasta. Mitä tämä sähkösanoma sitten sisälsi? Mitä Blix oli kirjoittanut? Vain  tämän: » Kaikki tullut ilmi. Pakene heti !» Vaikka he kuinka ahkeraan sen jälkeen kuljeskelivat kaupungilla,  punatukkaista eivät Blix ja Condy koskaan enää tavanneet! Eikä häntä  myöskään enää näkynyt Lunan ravintolassa, jossa hän kuitenkin oli  ollut vakituinen vieras. Hän katosi. Hän tuli niellyksi. He olivat  nähneet hänen jättävän ravintolan. Niin. Oliko hän myöskin jättänyt  koko neliön? Oliko hän paennut kaupungista, valtiosta, ehkä koko  Yhdysvalloista? Minkä ruumiin punatukkaisen kuormassa olivat nuo viisi  sanaa herättäneet kuolleista ja kutsuneet päivänvaloon? Olivatko  he säikyttäneet hänet elinijäksi pakenemaan tuntemattoman kostajan  kättä — tehneet hänestä uuden vaeltavan juutalaisen? Mikähän oli se  kauhea arvoitus, jota he olivat hipaisseet tuossa vaatimattomassa  pienessä esikaupunkiravintolassa. Minkähän salaperäisen oven he olivat  aukaisseet; minkähän punatukkaisen hirviön he olivat kutsuneet esille?  Olivatko he tehneet tyhjäksi konnantyön, tukahuttaneet salaliiton,  estäneet rikoksen? Sitä eivät he koskaan saaneet tietää. Vain yksi asia  oli vanna. Punatukkaisella miehellä oli ollut entisyys. Sillä välin solui minuutti minuutin perästä ilman että K.D.B.  näyttäytyi. Kapteeni Jack kävi nähtävästi kärsimättömäksi ja  hermostuneeksi. Hän oli nyt ehtinyt meksikkolaiseen naukkuun, jonka  nimi on mescal. Hän oli jo melkein lopettamaisillaan ateriansa. Joka  silmänräpäys katsoi hän kelloaan ja vilkasi ovelle. Kello oli jo  kaksikymmentä minuuttia yli seitsemän. »Saattepa nähdä, että punatukkainen sittenkin on kaikki tuhonnut»,  sanoi Blix hiljaa. »K.D.B. on nähnyt heidät molemmat istumassa täällä  ja alkanut pelätä.» »Voimmehan lähettää kapteenille sähkösanoman häneltä», ehdoitti Condy. »Minä olen nyt valmis vaikka mihin.» »Mitä se sisältäisi?» »Että hän on saanut esteen, luonnollisesti. Ehdottaa uutta kohtausta.» »Kapteeni loukkaantuisi. Hän ei ikimaailmassa suostuisi uuteen  kohtaukseen. Merikapteenit ovat ylen lyhytnokkaisia, niinkuin tiedätte.» Richard toi heille samassa kahvia ja kirsikkalikööriä ja Condy opetti Blixiä sulattamaan sokeripalasta ja imellyttämään kahvia siirapilla. Mutta he tulivat narratuiksi. Kapteeni oli valmis lähtemään. K.D.B. oli ilmeisesti pitänyt häntä narrinaan. Sitten esiintyi hän äkkiä. He huomasivat heti, että se oli hän. Katuovi avattiin ripeästi  ja suljettiin taas, ja kapteeni Jack oli tuossa tuokiossa vallan  valveillaan. Hän teki salaman nopeasti käsittämättömän manööverin.  Ennenkun ovi oli sulkeutunut, pyyhkäsi hän kädellään napinreikää ja  repi pois vuohensilmäkukkasen. Se oli aivan vaistomainen teko; sen ymmärsi Blix samassa kun hän sen  näki. Entinen kapteeni ei ollut tehnyt sitä harkinnan perusteella.  Hän ei ollut nähnyt tulijan kasvoja. Hän ei ollut näyttäytynyt  etuhuoneessa, eikä ollut edes ehtinyt sulkea ovea jälkeensä. Mutta  samalla sekunnilla kun kapteeni oli vilahdukselta nähnyt kimpun  valkoisia päivänkakkaroita hänen vyössään, oli hän tuntenut olevansa  pakoitettu salaamaan kuka hän oli, tietämättä itsekään minkätähden. »Hän pelkää», kuiskasi Blix. »Luulenpa että hän todellakin pelkää. Miehet ovat oikeita tomppeleja!» Sillä välin oli K.D.B:llä, tuolla kauan kaivatulla, josta niin paljon  oli väitelty, joka oli juonien saartama ja paljon diplomatian esine,  ylen hienot sotatemput, hänellä oli se haka, jonka ympärillä niin monet  suunnitelmat pyörivät, hänellä oli monien ristiriitaisten harrastusten  myrskykeskus, oli se pilvenpatsas, joka ikiajoiksi oli pyörteisiinsä  imenyt punatukkaisen sydämen ilon — K.D.B. oli tullut huoneeseen, jossa  meidän persoonamme istuivat. »Mutta — hänhän on kaunis !» pääsi Blixiltä puoleksi tukahdutettu  huudahdus, ikäänkuin olisi hän odottanut hirvittävän vanhaa naista. K.D.B. oli paremman palvelustytön näköinen, ja oli todellakin varsin  sievä puvussaan. Hän oli solakka, pienenlainen ja hänellä oli virkeät  silmät ja päättävä suu. Hänen koko olennossaan oli täydellisen  mielentyyneyden leima; hän näytti hyvin ymmärtävältä ja taipuvalta.  Blix oli varma siitä, että hän oli niitä, jotka eivät anna minkään  häiritä eikä kiihoittaa itseään. Hän oli rauhallinen, ei sillä, ettei  hänellä olisi ollut intohimoja, vaan sentähden, että hän halveksi  antautua niiden valtaan. Rauhallinen, ei niinkuin nilviäinen, vaan  niinkuin täysikasvuinen, kontemplatiivinen kissa. Tyynesti istahti hän nurkkapöydän ääreen, tyynesti riisui hän  hansikkaansa ja harsonsa ja tyynesti tarkasti hän huonetta ja niitä  kolmea, jotka siinä istuivat. Condy ja Blix tuijottivat kahvikuppeihinsa, niinkuin syyllisyydestään  tietoiset liittolaiset, mutta katsoivat ylös, kun kapteenin pöydästä  kuului kalinaa. Siellä putosi kuppi permannolle. Kapteeni Jack oli räjähtämäisillään. Tähän asti oli hän käyttäytynyt  niinkuin sivistynyt ja vakaantunut vanhanpuoleinen herra, joka  hallitsi tilannetta ja itseään. K.D.B:n tulo oli nähtävästi tuottanut  hänelle lievän hulluuden. Hän nieli ja hikoili, hänen kauluksensa  vaivasi häntä, hän vääntelihe ja kääntelihe tuolillaan. Hän mittasi  sylkylaatikkoa uhkaavalla katseellaan. Hän ryki niin että lasit  kilisivät. Hän siveli partaansa. Hän hikoili yhä vain entistä enemmän;  hän äyhki ja vaahtosi, ja hänet tavotti äkkiä mieletön halu nauraa.  Vain kerran uskalsi hän katsoa K.D.B:tä, joka istui ja ruoti kalaansa,  ollen täydellisesti tasapainossa; kun hän kohtasi hänen katseensa,  pudotti hän etikkapullon ja pippurirasian lattialle. Hän käyttäytyi  aivan samalla lailla kuin suuri koiranpenikka, joka makaa samassa  huoneessa kuin järkähtämätön kotikissa torkuksissa uuninkomerossa. »Hänen pitäisi saada selkäänsä», kuiskasi Blix, jonka kärsivällisyys  oli loppumaisillaan. »Kuvitteleeko hän, että hänen pitää ottaa  ensimmäinen askel?» »Ooh — mr!» jyrisi kapteeni ja rykäisi kahdennenkymmenennen kerran,  samalla kun hän punoi viiksiään ja kätki sitten tummanpunaiset kasvonsa  tavattoman suureen nenäliinaan. Kului viisi minuttia. Hän istui yhä vain paikallaan. Silloin tällöin  tarkasti K.D.B. häntä tyynellä mielenkiinnolla ja jatkoi sitten taas  sirosti kalansa käsittelyä. »Luuletteko, että hän tietää, että se on hän, nyt kun hän on ottanut  pois vuohensilmäkukan?» kuiskasi Condy. »Kyllä, siitä saatte olla varma! Luuletteko, ettei naisilla ole silmiä  päässä. He eivät onneksi ole niin höperöjä kuin miehet tapaavat olla.  Ellei hän uskoisi, että se on hän, menisi hän tiehensä. Ja katso,  kuinka hän on kaunis, Condy! Hänen pitäisi kiittää luojaansa, sitä  hänen pitäisi. Ajatelkaahan vain, kuinka hirvittävä hän olisi voinut  olla! Hän ei näytä olevan kolmenkymmenenyhden vuoden vanha.» »No, niin», vastasi Condy, »kun hän itse sanoo olevansa  kolmekymmentäyksi-vuotias, voitte lyödä vetoa siitä, että nuorempi hän ei ole. Se on yhtä varma kuin amen kirkossa.» »Joka tapauksessa on huvittavaa nähdä minkälaisia ihmisiä ne ovat,  jotka laittavat lehtiin avioliitto-ilmoituksia», sanoi Blix. »Minä olen  aina luullut, että ne ovat hirvittäviä ihmisiä.» »Niin, siinä nyt näette», vastasi Condy. »Sanoinhan minä, että te  erehdytte. Mutta saattaahan olla, että meitä onni on erityisesti  suosinut. Tämä on joka tapauksessa kyliäkin kunnioitettava.» »Se on selvää. Mutta minkätähden ei hän jo ryhdy asiaan, tuo kapteeni.»  Blix oli aivan alakuloinen. »Minkätähden istuu hän tuossa kuin maalattu  pukki?» »Hän odottaa, että me menemme», sanoi Condy. »Siitä olen vakuutettu.  Siitä ei tule mitään niinkauan kuin me olemme täällä. Menkäämme ja  antakaamme heille tilaisuus siihen. Kun he jäävät kahden, täytyy toisen heistä sanoa jotakin. Muuten eivät he kestä. Heistä on tuntuva  siltä, niinkuin he olisivat yksin asumattomalla saarella.» »Niin, mutta meidänhän piti sitä katsella», väitti Blix. »Emmehän me missään tapauksessa saata kuulla mitä he sanovat.» »Sitten emme koskaan saa tietää kuinka käy — tai kuka avaa tulen.» »Sen tekee K.D.B.», väitti Condy. »Ei ikinä!» kuiskasi Blix loukkaantuneena. »Minäpä sanon teille jotakin. Me voimme mennä ja sitten tulemme  takaisin viiden minuutin kuluttua. Minä unohdan keppini.» »Sen te kaiketi muutenkin tekisitte», pilaili Blix. He sopivat siitä, että se oli paras keino. Sitten kokosivat he  kapineensa, ja Condy jätti keppinsä riippumaan vaatenaulakkoon. Richardin tavattomaksi hämmästykseksi astui Blix etuhuoneessa olevan  pöydänteen luo ja maksoi laskun. Mutta kun heidän piti mennä pysähdytti  Condy hänet. »Te unohdatte tarjoilijan», sanoi hän ankarasti Richardin myhäillessä  ja kumarrellessa. »Viisikymmentä senttiä on pienin määrä minkä voitte  antaa hänelle.» Richard esteli, vaan Condy pysyi lujana. Puoli dollaria  juomarahoiksi. » Aateluus velvoittaa », selitti hän arvokkaasti. He menivät tuomiokirkon ohi ja seisoivat hetkisen ja kuuntelivat,  kun tornikello löi kahdeksan. Sitten tulivat he ajatelleeksi, että  ravintola suljetaan siihen aikaan ja kiiruhtivat sinne takaisin. He  tulivat sisälle ja katselivat huolestuneina ympärilleen. »Mahdoinkohan minä unohtaa keppini tänne?» sanoi Condy kääntyen  Richardin puoleen, joka seisoi pöydänteen takana ja riisui  esiliinaansa. Richard ei ollut sitä nähnyt. »Ehkäpä minä jätin sen tuonne sisälle, missä me istuimme», sanoi Condy  ja riensi sisähuoneeseen Blixin seuraamana. Hän löysi varsin oikein  keppinsä ja tuli ja näytti sen Richardille. »Niin, se oli siellä», sanoi hän. »Minä unohdan aina tämän kepin.» »Tervetuloa vastakinl» sanoi Richard ja piti kumartaen oven auki heille. Ulkona käytävällä puristivat Blix ja Condy toistensa käsiä molemmin  puolin onnitellen toisiaan ponnistustensa kauniista tuloksesta.  Sisähuoneessa olivat he nähneet avioliittokokelaittensa istuvan saman  pöydän ääressä kimppu pahoin rutistettuja vuohensilmäkukkia välillään  ja vakavasti keskustellen tekevän tuttavuutta toistensa kanssa. Blix huokasi syvästi helpotuksesta ja tyytyväisyydestä! »Vihdoinkin ovat sitten K.D.B. ja kapteeni Jack löytäneet toisensa.» VIII. »Mutta», lisäsi hän, kun he lähtivät menemään, »nyt emme koskaan saa  tietää kuka heistä ensiksi puhui.» Condy tunsi jo omantunnon soimauksia. »Ei sitä koskaan tiedä, ei sitä koskaan tiedä», mumisi hän  huolestuneena. »Olemme ehkä tehneet kerrassaan mielettömän työn.  Otaksukaa, että he tulevat onnettomiksi avioliitossaan! Toivoisin,  että me emme olisi sitä tehneet. Minä olen siitä pahoillani. Me olemme  pelanneet shakkia elävillä ihmisillä. Meillä on hirvittävä edesvastuu.  Otaksukaa, että se päättyy siihen, että hän murhaa hänet.» »Lorua ja tyhmyyksiä, Condy! Ja sitä paitsi, jos olemme tehneet  pahaa avioliittokokelaillemme, niin olemme me sen sijaan tehneet  punatukkaiselle hyvää. Kuka tietää, te olette ehkä tuolla  sähkösanomalla estänyt rikoksentekijän — tekemästä murhaa.» Condy ei voinut olla hymyilemättä ajatellessaan sähkösanoman vaikutusta. »Paetkaa heti», kertasi hän. »Hän pakenee kyllä minkä kerkiää. Kaikki  tullut ilmi! Antaisin halusta puoli dollaria —». »Jos teillä vain olisi.» »Niin, jos minulla vain olisi — saadakseni tietää mitä se oli, jonka me  saimme ilmi.» Äkkiä tarttui Blix hänen käsivarteensa. »Tuolla ne ovat, Condy.» »Kutka? Kutka siellä ovat?» »Kapteeni ja K.D.B.» »Ah — niin, luonnollisesti. Heidän oli pakko lähteä, poloisten. Ravintola suljetaan kello kahdeksan.» Blix ja Condy olivat hiljalleen kulkeneet käytävää kohti Pacific-Streetia, nyt saavuttivat K.D.B. ja hänen kavaljeerinsa heidät. Sivumennen kuulivat he kapteenin sanovan: — »hypähtää ylös tietenkin ja sanoo: Siitä tuli kansainvälinen asia! Se mursi —». Loppu hukkui ohi-rämiseväin kuormarattaiden aikaansaamaan meluun. »Hän kertoo hänelle paraillaan seikkailujaan!» huusi Blix. »Onpa  oivallista! Othello ja Desdeinona. Nyt he ovat päässeet oikein  vauhtiin.» »Seuratkaamme heitä!» huudahti Condy. »Seurata heitä? — Niin — mutta eikö se olisi jotakuinkin — sopimatonta?» »Ei, ei meille. Kun me kerran olemme ottaneet ohjataksemme heidän  kohtaloaan, on meidän sitä edelleenkin tehtävä.» He laskivat uhrinsa kappaleen matkaa edelle ja seurasivat sitten heitä.  Ei ollut syytä pelkoon, että heidät huomattaisiin. Kapteeni ja K.D.B.  näkivät vain toisensa. Kulkipa K.D.B. jo kapteenin kanssa käsikoukkua. »Ne sopivat todellakin toisilleen», sanoi Blix. »Minnekähän he nyt  menevät? Toiseen ravintolaanko?» Sitä he eivät tehneet. Blix ja Condy seurasivat heitä  Washington-torille, sinne, missä tuo suuri penikulmapatsas ja  lipputanko ovat; siellä pysähtyivät K.D.B. ja hänen seuraajansa  tavallisella yksityisellä portilla pari taloa ohi venäläisen  kirkon ylösalaisin käännettyine ilmapallotornineen. He juttelivat  vielä hetkisen toistensa kanssa; sitten sanoivat he hyvää yötä, ja  K.D.B. meni sisälle kapteenin seisoessa kunnioittavasti kumarrellen  hattu kädessä. Sitten hän oikaisihe, pani ylpeänä hatun rennosti  takaraivolle, katseli taloa ylhäältä alas asti ja meni iloisesti  viheltäen torin yli. »Hyvin arkipäiväistä, täysin kunnioitettavaa», hyväksyi Blix, ja Condy  veti helpotuksen huokauksen. »Niin», sanoi hän, »olisi voinut käydä pahemmin.» »Me emme kaiketikaan koskaan enää näe avioliittokokelaitamme», sanoi  Blix, »eivätkä he edes aavistakaan, että meitä on olemassa, mutta mepä  sittenkin olemme sen järjestäneet. Sitten saavat he itse kirjoittaa  romaanin valmiiksi. Minä olen sitä mieltä, että olemme tehneet hyvän  päivätyön. Ja niinpä on meidän nyt huolehdittava siitä, että itse  tulemme kotiin. Huomaan, että olen hirveän väsynyt. Millainen päivä  meillä onkaan ollut!» Kun he saapuivat Washington-vuoren huipulle, oli kaikki verhottu  sumuun, joka on San Franciscon vanha eroittamaton seuralainen. Se  vetelehti ja ajelehti kaikkialla. Asfaltti oli kuin kiillotettua  mustaapuuta. Talot näkyivät vain epäselvinä pilvijoukkoina molemmin  puolin katua. Palmu- ja eucalyptuslehdistä valui kosteus melkein  sateena. Kaukaa valtamereltä ulvoi sumutorvi kuin vihainen sonni. *       *       *       *       * Condy oli aikonut antaa sukeltajakertomukselleen nimen »Muuan  vedenalainen romaani», mutta sen nimen oli Blix hyljännyt. »Se muistuttaa liian paljon vesivärireklaamia», sanoi hän. »Sen nimellä  pitää olla aivan toinen ryhti. Teillä on taipumusta komeilemiseen,  Condy; te ette voi pysähtyä oikeaan aikaan. Mutta minua ilahduttaa,  että te olette tauonnut käyttämästä pilkullisia kaulaliinoja ja että te  olette hankkinut itsellenne valkoisia paitoja vaaleanpunaisten tilalle;  se osoittaa, että teillä on kehittymismahdollisuuksia.» »Niin — kyllä», sanoi hän. »Minusta ne vaikuttavat levollisemmilta.»  Aivan niinkuin se olisi ollut hänen omaa keksintöään. Blix antoi hänen  olla siinä uskossa. Lopuksi romaani sai nimen: »Kuoleman voitto», ja siitä tuli oivallinen.  Condyssa oli siksi paljon synnynnäistä kirjailijaa, että hän kyllä  itse tiesi, milloin hän oli saanut aikaan jotakin todellakin etevää.  Kun konekirjoittaja palautti kertomuksen selvän painon kirkastamana  ja vahvistamana, luki Condy sen uudestaan ja joutui itse aivan  haltioihinsa. Sillä oli aito sointu. »Se kelpaa!» sanoi hän luettuaan viimeisen ponnen. »Se on maalinsa  saavuttanut. Hyljätköön vain kernaasti sen joka ikinen, jos haluavat.  Mutta sitä ei vain voida mitättömäksi tehdä.» Mutta siihenpä sitten Condyn innostus häipyi. Sammunut oli tulinen  kauneuden kaipuu, joka oli häntä työssä kannustanut. Hän oli  tyytyväinen työhönsä. Hän oli kirjoittanut hyvän kertomuksen ja  sillä hyvä. Oli tietenkin tarkoitus lähettää se itään päin —  Riemukustannusliikkeelle — huomenna — tai ylihuomenna — jolloinkin  viikon varrella. Käsikirjoituksen lähettäminen veisi vähintäin puolisen  tuntia. Hänen oli ostettava postimerkit palauttamista varten, hänen  piti kirjoittaa kirje, hänellä piti myös olla suuri kotelo, ja sitten  oli välttämättömästi hankittava tarkka osoite. Juuri sillä hetkellä oli  hänellä lehdessä työtä. Romaanin lähettäminen siirtyi päivästä toiseen.  Se ei enää paljoakaan hänen mieltään kiinnittänyt. Sitä paitsi selvisi  hänelle myöskin, että hänellä oli muuta ajateltavaa. Oli ollut varsin helppoa luvata Blixille olla pelaamatta klubissa  hänen seurapiiriinsä kuuluvien toisten nuorten miesten kanssa, mutta  jos lupaaminen on helppoa, on pitäminen vaivaloista. »Tämä on aivan  hornamaista», sanoi hän itselleen. Monta kertaa oli hän ensimmäisten  neljäntoista päivän kuluessa sopimuksen jälkeen turvautunut Bessemerien  pieneen huoneustoon Washington-vuorella. Ja Blix oli aina ottanut hänet  sillä tavalla vastaan, niinkuin kaikki tyyni olisi ollut erinomaisen  hauskaa heidän yhteisen huvinsa vuoksi. Kortit esille. Mutta hän  ymmärsi varsin hyvin, mikä taistelu hänen oli kestettävä ja kuinka  vaikea hänen oli pysyä poissa klubin hiljaisessa huoneessa olevasta  vihreästä pöydästä ja paitahihasillaan siellä olevista tovereista. Hän  pani toivonsa siihen aikaan, jolloin Condy kokonaan taukoisi pelaamasta  hänenkin kanssaan. Mutta hän oli liian käytännöllinen ja ymmärtäväinen  tyttö odottaakseen että monivuotinen tapa talttuisi viikossa tai  parissa. Siihen vaadittiin aikaa. Toisinaan tunsi hän itsensä hieman  epävarmaksi siitä oliko menettelytapa moraalisesti oikeutettu. Mutta  nyt, kun Condy tässä suhteessa oli kokonaan jäänyt hänen varaansa,  pelasi hän 2—3 iltaa viikossa ja silloinkin vain kaksi tuntia  kerrallaan. Varemmin oli hän melkein joka ilta ollut tavattavissa  klubin pelipöydässä, vieläpä pitkälle yli sydänyön. Condy oli ilmoittanut Sargeantille, että hän oli »kääntynyt» uhkapeliin  nähden, ja että hän tulisi kieltäytymään pelistä ainakin pari  kuukautta. Sargeant oli liian hyvin kasvatettu ollakseen tunkeileva,  eikä hän sen koommin koskaan puhunut eristä, kun Condy oli saapuvilla,  toiset seurustelupiiriin kuuluvat olivat yhtä hienotunteisia, ja vaikka  he ensi alussa vähän pilailivat hänen poisjäämisestään, jättivät  he ennen pitkää asian sikseen. Condy mietti mielessään, että joka  tapauksessa oli olemassa monta hyvää ihmistä. Ne olivat nähtävästi  kaikki sopineet siitä, että helpottaisivat asian hänelle ja hän kirosi  itseään hulttiona. Eräänä tiistai-iltana lähempänä seitsemää, vähän aikaa kalaretken  ja avioliittosuunnitelman jälkeen, oli Condy kotonaan ja pukeutui  päivälliskutsuja varten. Sargeantin sisar oli kutsunut hänet  nuorisopäivällisille yliopistoklubille. Ja sitten oli hän itselleen ja  vierailleen tilannut aition eräässä kaupungin teatterissa, jossa muuan  amatööriseurue antoi näytännön hyväntekeväisyystarkoitusta varten.  Mutta kun hän nyt siinä seisoi siistien paidannappejaan vanhalla  hammasharjalla, sattui hänen katseensa Laurie Flaggin käsialalla  kirjoitettuun kirjelippuun, joka oli hänen kirjoituspöydällään ja oli  ollut siinä siitä asti, kun se kymmenen päivää sitten siihen tuli.  Condy jähmettyi kauhusta, lennätti hammasharjan nurkkaan ja vaipui  voihkien tuolille istumaan. Neiti Flagg oli kutsunut samasta syystä  ja samalla ohjelmalla, ja hän muisti nyt myöskin ottaneensa kutsun  vastaan; sillä kertaa oli hän aivan unohtanut, että hän töiden takia  oli estetty menemästä. Nyt oli liian myöhäistä oikaista erehdystä. Hän  ei voinut mennä toisen nuoren naisen luo loukkaamatta toista. »No niin, niin, olenpa sitten menemättä; sillä se asia on selvä»,  ilmoitti hän lujalla äänellä seinälle. »Minä lähetän heille  sähkösanoman ja sanon olevani kipeä taikka että minulla on työtä  toimituksessa, ja sitten — niin, kuolema ja kidutus! Minä menen  tervehtimään Blixiä. Me voimme lukea jotakin yhdessä ja sitten itse  laittaa ruokaa keittiössä.» Niin pian kun tämä ajatus sukeltautui hänelle, tuli hän säteilevän  iloiselle tuulelle; siinä ei ollut mitään arvelemista. Hänen  sydämeltään putosi kuin kivi. Eikä hän sitä paitsi olisi kovinkaan  kauan viihtynyt kummassakaan noista toisista paikoista. »Siellä  pitää istua paidan rintamus jäykkänä kuin lauta», murisi hän, »ja  olla kaulaliinan vaivaamana, samalla kun hymyilee koko naamallaan  ja juttelee tyhjää nuoren naisen kanssa, jonka sukunimeäkään ei voi  muistaa! Huvittaako se ehkä minua? Oliko minulla siitä mitään hyötyä?  Antaako se minulle aatteita? Eipä suinkaan! Minkätähden sitten menisin  sinne? Niin, minä en sitä tiedä.» Puhuessaan itsekseen oli hän potkaissut kiiltonahkakengät jaloistaan,  kiskaissut lattialle mustat housut ja keventynein mielin ottanut  esille sheviottipukunsa. »Ooh, oikeinpa tekee hyvää!» nyökytti hän  tyytyväisenä, vaihtaessaan jäykän seurustelupuvun mukavaan arkipukuun. Hän suorastaan nautti siitä, että sai ylleen pehmeän, sinisen paidan ja  keltaiset kävelykengät. »Mutta punaiset ruusukkeet ovat olleet ja menneet», ilmoitti hän  sitoessaan mustaa silkki-»klubi»-liinaa peilin edessä. »Siinä hän oli  oikeassa.» Hän pisti savukekotelon taskuunsa, otti hansikkaat ja kepin,  pani hatun päähänsä ja lähti menemään Bessemerille iloisen odotuksen  vallassa, jota hän ei moneen päivään ollut kokenut. Blix oli kyllä nähnyt hänen tulevan, sillä hän aukaisi itse hänelle  oven, mutta hänen päähänsä pälkähti äkkiä kohdella häntä niinkuin  kulkukauppiasta tai kirjasten myyjää. »Ei, kiitos», sanoi hän ylimielisesti nenä pystyssä, samalla kun hän  piteli ovea. »Ei, kiitoksia, tänään emme osta mitään. Meillä on Abraham  Lincolnin elämäkerta. Emme tilaa loistoteoksia. Meillä on huono aisti  täällä, meillä on ruusukkeita arkihuoneessa. ’Suurten miesten äitejä?’  Ei, kiitos!» Mutta Condy oli nähnyt pari nuorta naista alempana portailla ja vastasi  nyt kovalla, vihaisella äänellä: »Niin, suonette anteeksi, mutta me emme iänkaiken voi odottaa vuokraa.  Minä olen vain vuokrankantaja eikä minulla ole mitään tekemistä  korjausten kanssa. Teillä on kolmen kuukauden vuokra maksamatta; se  teidän on ensin maksettava, sitten voipi kyllä…» Blix veti hänet sisään ja paukahutti oven kiinni. »Mutta Rivers !» huusi hän hehkuvin poskin. »Ne olivat meidän  naapureitamme. He saattoivat kuulla joka sanan. Mitä he ajattelevat?» »Vähätpä siitä! He saavat mieluummin luulla, että minä olen  vuokrankantaja kuin kirjojen kaupustelija. Ja te aloititte — hyvää  iltaa, neiti!» »Hyvää — iltaa — herra!» Niin iloisesti alkoi Condyn pieni iltatervehdys. Jatko muodostui melko  vakavammaksi. Aterian jälkeen luki Blix ääneen Riversin istuessa ja  polttaessa savukkeita ulkonemassa. Mutta heti kun alkoi pimetä, pani  hän pois kirjan, ja he asettuivat tavallisille paikoilleen ikkunan  ääreen katsomaan kuinka aurinko meni mailleen yli kultaisen portin. Oli niin lämmin, että he saattoivat pitää pari ikkunaa avoinna, ja  kauan istuivat he hämärässä kuunnellen kaupungin melua. Vähitellen  se vaimeni ja oli lopulta vain kuin hillitty murina tai suhiseva  ääni, joka nousi ja laski kuin nukkuvan jättiläiseläimen hengitys.  Puolipimeässä näkyi Condyn savuke vain hehkuvana pisteenä. Savu  ajelehti ulos avoimesta ikkunasta pitkähköinä sinisinä pilvinä. Blix  nojautui hänen käsivarteensa ja käsi pyöreän, lujan leuan alla katseli  hän alas pimenevää kaupunkia. Hän istui niin lähellä Condya, että tämä  varsin hyvin saattoi tuntea hänen vaatteittensa, hiustensa, kaulansa,  koko hänen nuoren naisellisuutensa heikon, hurmaavan tuoksun. Siinä  missä hän istui, saattoi hän nähdä hänen päänsä ja hartiansa varjokuvan  avonaisen ikkunan hiestynyttä kultakuvastinta vasten, valkoisen otsan  kaarron ja paksut keltaiset hiukset valuen aaltoilevina laineina hänen  ohimoiltaan ja korviltaan, kuulakkaat, kukoistavat posket, säihkyvät,  pienet, tummanruskeat silmät ja lujan, punaisen suun, jonka piirteitä  vielä leuan alla oleva käsi lujensi. Hänellä oli nytkin tapansa mukaan  leveä, valkoinen atlassinauha kiinteästi solmittuna pyöreän, voimakkaan  kaulansa ympäri; mutta atlassin ja pienen ruusunpunaisen korvalehden  väliltä vilahti kolmikulmainen kaistale valkoista ihoa kaulan ja  posken vaiheella; ja Condy aavisti, että se olisi untuvaa pehmeämpi,  sileämpi silkkiä, lämpöinen ja raikas ja tuoksuva kuin vastakypsynyt  omena. Ja Condy uneksi, että hänellä oli lupa kumartua hänen puoleensa  ja suudella tuota hänen kaulansa tai poskensa pientä täplää; ja häntä  hämmästytti, että se ajatus äkkiä valtasi hänet niin, että hänen täytyi  hengittää syvästi ja että vieno väristys kävi hänen lävitsensä aina  sormenpäihin asti. Ja sitten kulki ajatus edelleen. Mitenkä mahtaisi  olla, ellei hänen tarvitsisi peljätä torjumista, vaan voisi ojentaa  käsivartensa ja kietoa sen hänen lujan, pyöreän vyötäisensä ympäri ja  vetää hänet tiukasti puoleensa, niin että hän saisi hänen pehmeän ja  viileän poskensa omaansa vasten, voisi haudata kasvonsa noiden hiusten  unimaailmaan ja sitten nostaa nuo kasvot omiaan vasten — nuo kasvot,  joiden lujan, tyynen suun huulet paisuivat niin suloisesti — kaunis hän  oli ja armas ja vain yhdeksäntoistavuotias — ja niin … »Kuulkaa, sanokaa — emmekö — emmekö lukisi vielä vähäisen. Meidän  täytyy — täytyy tehdä jotakin!» Se sattui kuin pistos Blixiin. »Ooh, Condy, kuinka te säikytitte minut! Ei, kuulkaahan, minulla on  jotakin teille puhuttavaa; on jotakin, jonka tahdon teille kertoa.  Isällä ja minulla on ollut pari pitkää ja vakavaa keskustelua sen  jälkeen, kun te viimeksi olitte täällä. Ajatelkaa, minä olen saanut  luvan matkustaa pois.» »Mitä ihmettä!» Condy hypähti ylös. »Mihin taivaan nimessä te aiotte  lähteä? Koska se tapahtuu? Minkätähden te lähdette?» »New Yorkiin opiskelemaan lääketiedettä.» Condy oli hetken vaiti. Sitten teki hän liikkeen kuin poistaakseen  hänet. »No, sepä kaunista!» huusi hän. »Kadotkaa te vain! Elkää ollenkaan  välittäkö minusta. Lähdette New Yorkiin — opiskelemaan lääketiedettä —  niinkö sanotte? Siinä on se tuki, minkä maailma antaa; turhia seikkoja,  tietenkin. Te lähdette kaiketikin kotiin päivällisille joka päivä?» Sitten alkoi Blix selittää asiaa. Kävi selville että hänellä oli kaksi  tätiä; toinen leski, toinen naimaton. Leski, rouva Kihm, asui New  Yorkissa, hän oli rikas ja hänellä oli vissejä mielipiteitä naisen  »hyödyllisyyspiiristä». Toinen, neiti Bessemer, oli vanha, pieni, 50  vaiheella oleva nainen, joka kulki vain nimellä täti Dodd. Hän asui  tuossa vähemmän tunnetussa kaupunginosassa, jonka nimi on »Missionen».  Hänellä oli siellä pieni kartano. Condy sai nyt tietää, että rouva Kihm pari vuotta aikaisemmin oli  viettänyt muutamia talvikuukausia täällä rannikolla ja suuresti  mieltynyt Blixiin. Jo silloin oli hän herra Bessemerille tarjoutunut  ottamaan Blixin mukaansa New Yorkiin antaakseen hänen oppia yhtä ja  toista, mutta silloin ei vanhus ollut siihen suostunut. Nyt näytti  siltä, että hän oli uudistanut tarjouksensa. »Hän on oikein erinomainen vanha nainen», sanoi Blix, »hänessä ei ole  merkkiäkään naisasianaisesta, niinkuin luulette, mutta muuten hän  on oivallisempi kuin useimmat miehet. Hän hoitaa itse omaisuuttaan.  Viime kuussa kirjoitti hän useampia kirjeitä isälle ja pyysi, että hän  antaisi minun tulla sinne kolmeksi, neljäksi vuodeksi. Hänellä ei ole  lapsia eikä ole koskaan ollutkaan, eikä hän ole vähintäkään huvitettu  seuraelämästä, niin että hän tuntee kai olevansa hieman yksinäinen.  Jos minun on opiskeltava siellä, ei isän mieleen juolahdakaan antaa  sen käydä täti Kihmin kustannuksella, käsitättehän sen. Enkä minä  siinä tapauksessa lähtisikään. Mutta minä’ voin asua hänen luonaan ja  olla siellä kuin kotonani samalla kun opiskelen jotakin — opiskelen  lääketiedettä.» »Mutta minkä ihmeen takia teidän välttämättömästi! pitää lukea  lääkärintutkintoa varten?» huudahti Condy. »Niinkuin te olisitte  pakoitettu ansaitsemaan leipänne.» »Tiedän kyllä, ettei minun sitä tarvitse tehdä. Mutta minkätähden  ei minulla saisi olla oma työni niinkuin miehillä — niinkuin teillä  esimerkiksi? Voitteko sanoa minulle sen? Minusta oli se myöskin  eriskummallinen ajatus, kun se ensikerran valahti mieleeni, mutta  sitten tulin ajatelleeksi lähemmin asiaa, ja nyt tiedän, että se tekisi  minut onnelliseksi . Minä tahdon tehdä työtäni, ei sentähden että olen  siihen pakoitettu, vaan sentähden että se minua huvittaa. Te tiedätte,  Condy, etten minä ole vähintäkään emansipoitu ja minä inhoan miesmäisiä  naisia yhtä perusteellisesti kuin tekin.» »Niin, mutta opiskelemaan juur; lääketiedettä, Blix! Te ette tiedä mitä  puhutte.» »Kyliä, varmasti. On olemassa lääketieteellinen naisyliopisto New  Yorkissa. Se on parhaimpia maassa. Täti Kihm on lähettänyt minulle  prospektin. Minä en uneksikaan harjoittelemista, ymmärrättehän,  ainakaan en sitä tätä nykyä ajattele. Mutta täytyyhän ihmisellä  olla jotakin tekemistä; ja tottahan sitten on parempi opiskella  lääketiedettä kuin soittaa pianoa, opiskella ranskaa, kuunnella  kirjallisuusluentoja ja olla Browning-yhdistyksen jäsen. Tuskin  voin sietää sellaisia nuoria tyttöjä. Ja katsokaas miten edulliset  ehdot minulla on; täti on tavattoman kiltti. Ajatelkaas, hän sanoo,  että minä saan ajaa yliopistoon ja sieltä takaisin joka päivä hänen  kuomuvaunuissaan, ja sitten saan nähdä New Yorkin; vain asumalla  sellaisessa suurkaupungissa voipi oppia paljon.» »Te olette oikeassa, se on hyvin edullista teille», myönsi Condy. »Ja  minua miellyttää ajatus että te antaudutte opiskelemaan. Te olette kuin  luotu siihen, ja te tulette vieläkin paremmaksi kuin olette.» Kun Blix huomasi hänen olevan sävyisän, sanoi hän: »Niin, ja se onkin jo päätetty. Isä ja minä kirjoitimme eilen illalla.» »Milloin te matkustatte?» »Tammikuun ensimmäisellä viikolla.» »Vai niin, sinne on vielä aikaa. Mutta kuka täyttää teidän paikkanne  täällä. Kuinka kumman tavalla teidän isänne voi selviytyä ilman teitä?  Entä Detten ja Howard?» »Täti Dodd tulee hoitamaan taloutta.» »Tämä tuli hiukan yllätyksenä», sanoi Condy. »Mutta se on suuri asia,  Blix, ja minä iloitsen suuresti teidän puolestanne. Teidän uranne  on samalla viitoitettu. Kun teidän tätinne pitää niin paljon teistä  eikä hänellä itsellään ole lapsia, tekee hän luonnollisesti teidät  perillisekseen — ehkäpä hän heti lahjoittaa vissin määrän teille.  Ja te menette naimisiin jonkun pomon kanssa New Yorkissa ja olette  'fashionables news' ennenkun arvaattekaan.» »Mitä te nyt loruatte!» torui Blix. »Ei, minä lähden sinne aivan  yksinkertaisesti opiskelemaan lääketiedettä. Te ette tiedä kuinka se  ajatus minua ilahduttaa. Minä olen jo ostanut muutamia ensi lukuvuonna  tarvittavia kirjoja ja lukenut osan niistä. Te ette ehkä sitä usko,  Condy, mutta se on todellakin vielä parempaa kuin Kipling.» »Kunpa minäkin pääsisin New Yorkiin!» mumisi Condy mieli mustana. Blix unohti silmänräpäyksessä oman onnensa. »Niin, kunpa te pääsisitte!» huudahti hän. »Te olette aivan liian  hyvä tuolle sunnuntain lisälehdelle. Sen te tiedätte itse yhtä hyvin  kuin minä, ja minä olen kuullut monen muun sanovan samaa, kun he  ovat lukeneet teidän kertomuksianne. Täällä saatatte mennä samaa  menoa 20 vuotta, ja mitä te sillä voitatte? Istutte sunnuntailehden  aputoimittajana niinkuin nytkin! Ja pahinta on, että te kai lopulta  laskeudutte lepoon siinä mielessä, ettette te muuhun kelpaakaan. Mutta  teistä voipi tulla suuri kirjailija. Siitä olen varma. Minä uskon  teihin; Condy, ehdottomasti. Mutta niinkauan kuin tyydytte olemaan  täällä päivätyöiäisenä, ei teistä voi tulla muuta kuin kirjallinen  päivätyöläinen. Teidän täytyy murtautua eteenpäin ja laittaa, että pian  pääsette täältä pois. Tiedän että teillä kyllä on täällä huvia, mutta  on paljon, joka on parempaa kuin Kuvitteleminen — se on ajan pitkään  liian pientä. Päättäkääpä lähteä itäänpäin ja jättää kaikki sen varaan.  Te tahdotte sinne kernaasti, sen tiedän, mutta se ei riitä, että  kernaasti tahtoo. Innostus ilman tarmoa ei riitä. Innostusta teillä on,  Condy; tarvitsette ja teillä täytyy myöskin olla tarmoa. Teidän täytyy  oppia kieltäytymään monesta hauskasta asiasta; teidän täytyy tehdä  se ehdottomasti järkkymätön päätös, että te lähdette itään ja sitten  vain purra hampaat yhteen ja panna päätös täytäntöön. Ooh, sanonpa  sen teille, minä rakastan ja ihailen miestä, joka voi tehdä suuren  päätöksen ja panna sen täytäntöön.» Condy oli istunut ja katsellut häntä kun hän puhui, katsellut hänen  säkenöiviä, mustanruskeita silmiään, hänen hehkuvia poskiaan ja pieniä  käsiä, jotka puristautuivat pyöreiksi, vaaleanpunaisiksi nyrkeiksi. »Se on suurenmoista, Blix», huudahti hän. »Te olette kelpo tyttö! Te  voitte tehdä kuolleen eläväksi. Te olette niitä naisia, jotka luovat  miehiä. Nainen, joka tukee miestä, sellainen te olette. Te saatte  hänet kyllä ojasta ja viedyksi virran mukaan. On päivänselvää»,  jatkoi hän hetkisen kuluttua, »on päivänselvää, että minun pitäisi  lähteä New Yorkiin. Mutta olettakaa nyt, että minä lähden sinne,  Blix — mitä sitte? Minulla ei ole rahoja korkoja kasvamassa eikä  myöskään rikasta tätiä. Ellen saisi jotakin tointa — ja tuskinpa  sitä saisin ensimmäisinä 3—4 kuukautena — millä minä sillä aikaa  eläisin? Mitä poloinen pieni lintu tekisi? Minä olen köyhä nuori mies,  Bessemer, ja minulla on tapana syödä aina joskus toisinaan. Ei, ainoa  mahdollisuuteni on, että joku aikakauslehti tai kustannusyhtiö tai kuka  tahansa minut 'keksii' ja tekee minulle toisen tai toisen tarjouksen.» »Niin, ja sittenhän teillä on Riemukustannusliike. Se on osoittanut  mielenkiintoa teihin, Condy. Sitä teidän on pidettävä yllä ja  toimittava niin, ettei se tule unohtumaan. Oletteko lähettänyt  kustannusliikkeelle 'Kuoleman voiton'?» Seuraavana aamuna istui Condy täysihoitolassa kahvin ja pehmeiksi  keitettyjen munien ääressä ja tunsi olevansa niin kummallisen  alakuloinen ja pettynyt tietämättä oikein miksi. Hän ei välittänyt  mistään. Sanomalehti oli ikävä. Hänellä ei ollut hiventäkään halua  työhön, ja miten lie ollut auringonkaan laita tänä aamuna? Toimistoon  mennessään näki hän, ettei taivaalla ollut pilvenhattaraa, ja kuitenkin  oli kaikki niin kerrassaan loistotonta. Hän istahti kirjoituspöytänsä  ääreen ja tarttui työhönsä, mutta käsikirjoitusta siitä vain ei ottanut  tullakseen. Urheilutoimittaja kiusasi häntä hassuilla sukkeluuksillaan.  Hän saattoi aivan raivostua nähdessään selän miehestä, joka istui  ja leikkeli sanomalehtiä. Juoksupoika oli personoitu vaatimus  jumalanpilkkaamiseen. Condyssä ei ollut mitään elonvoimaa tänä  aamuna, ei vauhtia, ei jälkeäkään hänen tavallisesta elämänilostaan.  Ja sitä mukaa kuin tunnit kuluivat kävi hänen olonsa yhä pahemmaksi;  aamiaisella klubissa ei ruoka maistunut miltään; myöskin tupakka oli  menettänyt vetovoimansa. Iltapäivä oli yhtä ainoaa pitkää ikävää. Joka puolitunti heitti hän  kynän pois ollen täydellisesti kykenemätön muodostamaan yksijaksoista  lausetta; hän pisti kädet taskuihin ja tuijotti surullisena ulos  ikkunasta yli kattojen — yli tuon rumien, likaisten, tympäisevien  kattojen muodostaman erämaan, joka levittäytyi hänen allaan. Hän ikävöi  ilonpitoa, huvitusta, jännitystä! Oli joka tapauksessa jotakin, jota  hän halusi koko sydämellään, koko sielullaan, mutta mitä se oikeastaan  oli, sitä hän ei itse tiennyt. Jokin, jonka hän vielä eilen oli  omistanut, oli hänet tänään jättänyt, ja hän tiesi, ettei hän saisi  sitä takaisin huomenna eikä ylihuomenna eikä myöskään ylihuomenen  jälkeen. Mikä se oli? Hän ei voinut sitä sanoa. Kerran hän jo luuli,  että hän oli tulemaisillaan kipeäksi. Condyn äiti ei ollut kotona  sinä iltana, ja hän meni klubiin syömään päivällistä toivoen siellä  tapaavansa jonkun, jonka hän sitten saisi mukaansa teatteriin. Sargeant  tuli hänen luokseen, kun hän jo oli ehtinyt kahviin ja savukkeeseen,  mutta hän ei halunnut mennä teatteriin. »Te olette ehkä sopineet kortin peluusta tänä iltana?» kysyi Condy. »Saattaa kyllä olla niin», myönteli toinen. »Luulenpa, että minäkin otan pienen osakkeen tänä iltana», sanoi Condy.  »Minulla on ollut kohmelo koko päivän, ja tarvitsen jotakin, millä sen  hälvennän.» »Minä en suinkaan tahdo johtaa teitä kiusaukseen», sanoi Sargeant. »Ei tee mitään!» vakuutti Condy. »Aikani on jo jotakuinkin mennyt  umpeen.» Tuntia myöhemmin, juuri kun hänen yhdessä Sargeantin ja toisten seuraan  kuuluvien nuorten miesten kanssa piti mennä ylös portaita pelisaliin,  ojensi tarjoilija Condylle kirjelipun. Kaupunginlähetti,. joka sen  juuri oli tuonut, seisoi ja odotti vastausta. Se oli Blixiltä. Hän  kirjoitti: »Eikö teitä haluta tulla pelaamaan korttierää minun kanssani tänä  iltana? On jo enemmän kuin viikko viimeisestä.» »Kuinka hän saattoi sen tietää?» ajatteli Condy itsekseen. »Kuinka hän  saattoi tämän arvata?» Ääneen hän sanoi: »Minä en »ikävä kyllä» voikaan  tulla mukaan. Pikaviesti päätoimittajalta. Jotakin pikatyötä.» Ensi kerran sitten eilisillan tunsi Condy elonvoimiensa huojuvan  hänen mennessään Washington-Street-ylängölle. Mutta vaikka hänellä ja  Blixillä sinä iltana oli hauskempi kuin heillä yhdessä oli pitkään  aikaan ollut, yllätti hänet taas sama nimetön ja muodoton tuska melkein  samalla hetkellä, kun hän sanoi hänelle hyvää yötä. Ja sitä jatkui koko  viikon, se huomaantui hänen työssään. Hänen työnsä tuloksena oli, että  toimitussihteeri hylkäsi kolme hänen artikkeleistaan. »Emme me voi täyttää sanomalehteä tuollaisella pödyllä», oli  toimitussihteeri sanonut »Ettekö voi antaa meille novellia?» »Kyllä toki; minulla on jotakin siihen malliin, jonka varsin mielellään  voitte saada, jos suvaitsette sen painattaa», vastasi Condy epätoivon  syvästä alhosta. »Kuoleman voitto» julkaistiin The Times-lehden seuraavassa  sunnuntainumerossa lehden piirtäjän kuvittamana. Mutta kukaan ei  kiinnittänyt siihen huomiota. Ennenkun Condy sinä iltana paneutui levolle, oli hän lukenut sen vielä  viimeisen kerran. »Se on aivan yksinkertaisesti epäonnistunut», mumisi hän surullisesti  itsekseen heittäessään sanomalehden luotaan. »Se on pelkkää pötyä.  Haluaisinpa tietää mitä Blix sanoo. Minä en ole edes nuuskasiemauksen  veroinen. Mutta minä haluaisin kuitenkin tietää, minkätähden häntä niin  haluttaa lähteä New Yorkiin.» IX. Muuan Union Streetin vanhanaikaisista sähkölläkäyvistä  raitiotievaunuista ulkosivulla olevine mataline mukavine rahineen  jätti Blixin ja Condyn aivan linnan kenttävallin sisäpuolelle. Vartia,  joka raitiotien loppupäässä kulki ja keikaroi Jörgensen-kauluksessaan,  neuvoi Condylle tietä. Ja sitten meni Condy Blixin kera pitkää  puistotietä viheriäisten holvien alle. Ilma ei olisi voinut olla kauniimpi. Oli viikon vapaapäivä,  maanantai-aamu kymmenen ajoissa. Ilma ei ollut kylmä eikä lämmin,  se huokui vain leppoisesti ruoholta ja raikkaasti mereltä.  Vaaleansinertävällä taivaalla ei ollut ainoatakaan pilveä. Heidän  oikealla puolellaan jonkun matkan päässä oli lahti niin sinisenä  kuin indigo. Näytti siltä kuin Alcatraziin olisi vain lyhyt matka;  ja tuolla taaempana nosti Tamalpais valtavan, viheriän, punasen ja  purppuranvärisen pyramiidinsä vedestä, koko joukon korkeammalle kuin  pienet rannikkovuoret, ja katseli länteen yli aavan meren. Kenttävalli oli semmoisenaan hauska. Upseerien puistomajat olivat  tarpeeksi samanlaiset ja marssivat säännöllisissä kolonneissa  kuin aito sotilasesikunta. Tavattoman suuret parakit muistuttivat  opistojen makuusaleja; ylt'ympäri avoimissa ovissa istui sotamiehiä  paitahihasillaan puhdistaen satuloita ja valjaita, samalla kun he  viheltelivät jotakin säveltä tai polttivat lyhyttä piippua. Täällä  paraatipaikalla seisoi muuan sotilas, joka oli riisunut nuttunsa ja  liivinsä ja krokettinuijalla lähetti puolelle tusinalle tovereistaan  toisen nopean tai hitaan kuulan toisensa jälkeen. Tallien luona  harjasivat he hevosia, jotka seisoivat pitkissä riveissä ja olivat  kaikki samanlaisia väriltään. Nuori luutnantti solui hiljaa ohi  polkupyörällään. Muuan upseeri tuli ulos kuistin ovesta asenutun  napit auki ja piippunysä hampaissa. Pitkin polkuja oli pysty- tai  vaakasuorassa mustaksi maalattuja kanuunankuulia pitkissä riveissä,  ja mörssäreitä ja muuta vanhaa, kelpaamatonta tykistöä oli pantu  pystyyn kulmauksiin kuin siipimiehiä ainakin. Jonkun verran kauempana  törähytteli merkinantotorvi teräviä toitotuksiaan. Blix ja Condy olivat suunnitelleet pitkän retken täksi päiväksi.  Heidän piti mennä läpi linnan kenttävallin, ohi upseeripaviljonkien  ja parakkien ja edelleen Kultaisen portin luona olevalle vanhalle  linnoitukselle. Siellä he poikkeisivat sivulle ja seuraisivat  rannikkotietä kappaleen matkaa ja sitten he menisivät sisämaahan päin,  kulkisivat yli vuorien vajaan puoli neljännespenikulmaa tullakseen  lopulta kaupunkiin ja raitiotielinjoille takaisin. Condy oli tiukasti  ollut sitä mieltä, että pyöräilypuku oli tähän tilaisuuteen sopivin, ja  sitä paitsi oli hänellä pieni käsilaukku, jossa oli pari jalkineita,  sanoi hän. Ja Blix oli tänä aamuna ihana kuin ruusu, kokonaan mustiin puettu,  lukuunottamatta välttämätöntä valkoista silkkinauhaa, joka kietoutui  tiukasti ja korkeasti hänen kaulansa ympäri. St. Bernhardin-kaulanauha  täytti tehtävänsä vyönä. Hänellä ei nyt ollut harsoa, ja keltaiset  hiukset liehuivat hänen heleillä poskillaan. Hän kulki siinä hänen  rinnallaan askelin, jotka olivat yhtä lujat ja varmat kuin hänenkin, ja  hän heilutteli pyöreitä voimakkaita käsivarsiaan. Hänen pienet ruskeat  silmänsä loistivat hyväntuulisuudesta ja terveydestä ja pelkästä  raikkaasta ruumiillisesta nautinnosta, että oli olemassa tällaisena  puhtaana ja kirkkaana ja varhaisena aamuna täällä ulkona länsimeren  rannikolla. Hän puhui melkein herkeämättä. Tuskinpa hänen suunsa  oli sekuntiakaan hiljaa. Hän jutteli kauniista ilmasta, sotilaiden  uudesta lystillisestä tallilakista, viheriäisestä nurmiturpeesta  kenttävallilla, pienestä hautausmaasta, jonka ohi he menivät  parakkileirin takana, kaminista, jonka he näkivät, ja viiriäisestä,  jonka he molemmat kuulivat piipattavan ja raksuttavan pensaikossa. Condy kulki ääneti hänen rinnallaan, ääneti, vaan ei vähemmän  onnellisena, ja poltteli piippuaan ja tähysteli silloin tällöin suurta  laivaa, nelimastoista, jota hinattiin ulos Kultaiselle portille. Koko  ajan katselivat he ympärilleen, ja joka hetki keksivät he jotakin  mielenkiintoista, josta heidän täytyi toisilleen huomauttaa. »Kas tuolla, Blix!» »Mutta, Condy, näettekö tuota?» He olivat pian sivuuttaneet leirin pienoiskaupungin ja suuntasivat  kulkunsa edelleen parakkien ja vanhan punaisen linnoituksen välillä  olevan matalan hiekkapankin läpi. »Katsokaas, Condy», sanoi Blix, »mikä rakennus tuolla on lahdelman  rannalla — tuo lipputankoinen?» »Otaksun, että se on pelastusasema.» »Emmekö voisi mennä sinne sitä katsomaan — se olisi varsin hupaista.» »Loistava ajatus», huudahti Condy. Asemalle ei ollut pitkä matka. Heidän piti vain hyppiä kehnoa  rantatietä alas linnoitukselle ja kahlata pari sataa metriä läpi  hiekkariuttojen. Condy avasi veräjän pensasaidassa, joka ympäröi pientä  kaksikerroksista taloa, ja sieltä kuului ulvovien ja haukkuvien koirien  valtava, hornamainen kuoro. Kun sitten oli sisällä, niin huomasi, että paikalla oli omituinen  vetovoima. Simpukankuorien reunustama muurikivinen käytävä vei  lahdelmalle antavalle ovelle; molemmin puolin oli siellä pienille  hyvinhoidetuille nurmikoille asetettu 7—8 mullalla täytettyä, vanhaa,  kirjavaksi maalattua venosta, joissa verenpisarat, pelargonit ja  resedat kukkivat. Pari kissaa lojuili päivää paistattaen kumpikin  ikkunalaudallaan. Ylempänä jonkinlaisella parvekkeella astuskeli kaksi  miehistöön kuuluvaa edes takaisin, aivan kuin he olisivat kulkeneet  laivankannella. Siellä täällä paistoi aurinko esineisiin, jotka olivat  punaista kuparia tai kiiltävää messinkiä; vähän kauempana rannalla  oli pelastusveneen vaja telaratoineen portista suoraan veteen. Condy  koputti rohkeasti ovea. Se, joka avasi, oli — kapteeni Jack. Kapteeni Jack eikä kukaan muu. Mutta hän esiintyi nyt sinisessä,  kudotussa nutussa ja virkatakissa. Se oli heille aivan odottamaton yllätys, niinkuin äkillinen  näyttämömuutos teatterissa. Ovelle koputtaminen oli luonut aivan uuden  tilanteen. He seisoivat hetkisen aivan kuin kivettyneinä; he seisoivat  siinä kynnyksellä ja tuijottivat avoimin suin ja silmät selällään  heidän omaa äkisti esille sukeltautuvaa avioliittokokelastaan. Condy  oli suorastaan sanaton. Se oli Blix, joka lopulta pelasti tilanteen. »Me kuljimme juuri tästä ohi — olemme jalkamatkalla», selitti hän, »ja  sitten saimme sellaisen halun nähdä pelastusasemaa. Kävisikö se päinsä?  Voisimmeko saada luvan katsoa sitä?» »Kyllä, kernaasti», vastasi kapteeni varsin kohteliaasti. »Tulkaa vain  sisälle. Tämä on juuri tänään avoinna katsojille. Te olette tulleet  täsmälleen. — Täällä on niin harvoin kävijöitä», lisäsi hän. Sillä aikaa kun Condy kirjoitti heidän nimensä vieraskirjaan, onnistui  hänen vaihettaa pikainen silmäys Blixin kanssa. Oli selvää, että  kapteeni ei heitä tuntenut. Tilanne selveni itsestään, niin, näytti  sukeutuvan varsin lupaavaksi. Eikähän sitä paitsi tekisikään mitään,  vaikka kapteeni muistaisikin, että hän oli nähnyt heidät ennen. »Ei, meillä ei ole monta kävijää», jatkoi kapteeni viedessään heidät  kapeaa, hiekoitettua käytävää alas venevajaan. »Tämä on hiljainen  asema, tämä. Ihmiset eivät usein osu tälle tielle, ja harvoinpa  myöskin sattuu, että meidän on mentävä veneellä vesille. Mehän olemme  täällä sisäpuolella, ymmärrättehän, eikä meillä enimmäkseen ole mitään  tekemistä, paitsi veden korkeimmillaan ollessa, kun ne siellä Cliff  Housessa eivät voi saada venettään vesille. Me emme siis juuri usein  mene vesille, vaan jos menemme, niin voitte olla vakuutettuja siitä,  että me menemme täysin purjein.» »Minun nimeni on Rivers», sanoi Condy, »ja tämä on neiti Bessemer. Me  olemme kumpikin kaupungista.» »Minua ilahduttaa tutustua teihin, herra Rivers, minulla on kunnia,  neiti», sanoi hän ja paljasti päänsä. »Minun nimeni on Hoskins, mutta  te voitte kernaasti sanoa minua kapteeni Jackiksi. Olen niin tottunut  siihen nimeen, että tuskin tottelen toista. Siispä, neiti Bessemer,  tässä näette pelastusveneen. Se pysyy pinnalla aallokoissa, eikä voi  kaatua eikä upota, ja jos sanoisin kuinka monta tuhatta se on maksanut,  niin te ette uskoisi minua.» Condy ja Blix viettivät puoli tuntia varsin hauskasti venevajassa  kapteeni Jackin selittäessä ja kuvaillessa kaikellaista ja kertoessa  karilleajotapauksia ja eriskummallisia pelastus-kaskuja, niin että he,  lasten lailla, tuskin uskalsivat hengittää jännityksestä. Condy älysi pian, että hän täällä oli löytänyt jotakin sellaista, josta  kirjailijat niin usein puhuvat, mutta jota he niin harvoin tapaavat ja  jota he paremman nimen puutteessa sanovat »tyypiksi.» Kapteeni Jack oli ollut kaikkialla ja nähnyt kaikellaista ja kokenut  enimmäkseen kaikki mikä on kokemisen arvoista ja sen lisäksi vielä  koko joukon sellaista, josta hänen mieluummin olisi pitänyt pysyä  erillään. Mutta muutamissa asioissa oli kapteeni ilmeisesti aivan  yhtä moraaliton kuin vastasyntynyt lapsi. Hänellä ei nähtävästi  ollut hituistakaan omantunnonvaivoja siitä, että oli salakuljettanut  kiinalaisia Canadasta rajan yli kolmenkymmenen dollarin maksusta  hiuspiiskalta, jossa toimessa hänellä oli apulaisena maailmankuulun  amerikalaisen teologin tuhlaajapoika. Kelvottomien kiväärien vienti  Perun kapinallisille oli liikeasia, jota hänen täytyi valittaen  muistella, mutta vain sentähden, että se rengas oli murtunut, joka  jonkun aikaa oli antautunut sitä asiaa ajamaan. Erään vissin kuunarin  yksityinen takavarikointi Callaosin satamassa oli juttu semmoisenaan,  samalla kun merileijonannahkojen ryöstäminen kohnenkymmenentuhannen  dollarin arvosta venäläiseltä kauppapaikalta Alaskassa pääasiallisesti  sokeriputkirommin avulla — myöskin oli kiitettävä teko. Hän oli syntynyt, kertoi hän, Winchesterissâ Englannissa ja —  luvalla sanoen — kasvatettu hengellistä säätyä varten. Hän oli  jonkun aikaa ollut kuoripoikana Winchesterin tuomiokirkossa,  mutta sitten oli hän jo keskenkasvuisena poikana mennyt merille.  Hän oli ollut veneenkuljettajana New Bedfordista kotoisin  olevalla valaanpyytäjälaivalla, ja vain kuudentoista ikäisenä  harppunoinut ensimmäisen valaansa. Hän oli ollut merirosvona  Chilen puolella. Hän oli ollut jääluotsina eräässä pohjoisnavan  puoleisessa pelastusretkikunnassa; hän oli harjoittanut hainpyyntiä  Magdalena-lahdessa kiinalaisen miehistön kanssa, joka oli melkein  murhaamaisillaan hänet; hän oli ollut syvänvedensukeltaja ja  saanut rumpukalvonsa siinä työssä halki, niin että hän nyt saattoi  tupruttaa tupakansavua korvistaan; hän oli joutunut haaksirikkoon  Gilbert-saarilla, tapellut Etelä-Kalifornian saarien alku-asukkaiden  kanssa; myynyt samppanjaa — joka oli valmistettu rintasokerista,  kuohupulverista ja rusinamehusta — korealaisille, ollut ajurina  Rannalla William Evert Gladstonen istuessa ajurinrattaissa. Mutta  ennen muita hän muisteli ja kuvasi ilolla ja ylpeydellä sitä kertaa,  jolloin hän oli neekerilaulajien impressariona, jolloin hän vuokratussa  virkapuvussa uneksi Cunard-laivan ryöstämistä ja rumpumajurina marssi  Sakramenton pääkatua torvensoittajiensa seuraamana. »Seurueen primadonna», sanoi hän, »oli malmirumpua lyövä nainen. Me  olimme juhlineet Storktonissa, ja sitten antoi hän minulle timanttinsa  vietäväksi tamppiin. Minä tein työtä pyydettyä, mutta jäihän niitä  vähän riippumaan sormienkin väliin, ja minä lähdin puikahtamaan San  Franciscoon. Voittepa murskata kalloni, ellei hän tullut jälkeeni;  tuo helkkarin gongongi tapasi minut eräänä kauniina päivänä aivan  Basch-Streetilla olevan teatterin edustalla ja antoi minulle aika  sivalluksen ratsuruoskallaan. Niin, ajatelkaas vain» — ja sitten hän  hymyili, niinkuin se olisi ollut lystillisintä leikkiä maailmassa.» »Mutta», uskalsi Blix kysyä, »eikö teistä nyt tunnu täällä hiukan  ikävältä? Täällä on kai teistä hyvin yksinäistä. Luulisipa, että te  tarvitsisitte täällä jonkun, joka pitäisi teille seuraa ja laittaisi  teille ruokaa ja niin edes päin.» Mutta Condy ei välittänyt Blixin diplomatiasta; hän ei ajatellut muuta  kuin aiheita ja meni eteenpäin toista latua. »Niin», sanoi hän, »myöskin minusta tuntuu, että täällä olisi jotenkin  yksitoikkoista teille, joka olette tottunut niin työteliääseen elämään.  Kuinka on pälkähtänyt päähänne antautua tähän toimeen?» »Niin, katsokaahan», — kapteeni nojautui molemmat kädet housuntaskuissa  pelastusveneen sileään, valkoiseen keulaan — »minä olen hiukan  kallellani nykyään — olin joutunut jupakkaan Meksikossa, Libertadissa;  ja siitä nousi sellainen äläkkä, niin että mielestäni asian täytyi  saada rauhaa painuakseen ensin vähän unhotukseen. Sillä tavalla se  kävi, näette.» Condy ja Blix muistivat elämyksensä valaanpyytäjän perämiehen kanssa  ja olivat heti pelkkänä korvana. Blix istuutui kirstulle, joka oli  pohja pilviin päin käännettynä, kumartui eteenpäin kyynäspäät polvien  varassa ja katseli herkeämättä kapteenia mielenkiinnosta ja odotuksesta  loistavin silmin. Condy seisoi hänen vieressään ja poltteli savukkeen  toisensa jälkeen, samalla kun hänen sormensa kapteenin kertoessa elivät  jännityksestä ja tarkkuudesta. Kirjailija hänessä oli vallan valveilla. Ja täällä, tällä syrjäisellä pelastusasemalla, jossa lahdelman lempeät  laineet loiskuttivat rantaan niin lähellä, että he kuulivat joka  loiskeen, ja jossa tuntui maalin- ja köyden- ja rannalla olevan päivän  kuivaaman ruskolevänhajua, täällä kuuli nyt Blix ensimmäisen kerran  kertomuksen »Viranomaisista huolimatta». Kapteeni Jack alkoi ensin kertoa elämyksiään Seattlessa Washingtonissa  keltakuumeen aikana. Hän oli ensin rahastonhoitajana eräässä  ravintolassa, jonka päivittäinen puhdas tulo oli yli 800 dollaria.  Sitten kuoli omistaja äkkiä, ja hän, kapteeni Jack, jäi edelleen  hoitamaan ravintolaa, kunnes pesä tulisi selvitetyksi ja perilliset  kutsuttaisiin saapuville. Mutta vallitsevan sekasorron ja kiihoituksen  aikana ei pesää selvitetty, ja kun ei ketään perillistä ilmoittautunut,  otti hän itse haltuunsa koko laitoksen, maksoi verot, teki  sopimuskirjat ja kirjoitti laskuja, kunnes hän itse piti koko liikkeen  suunnattomine tuloineen omana laillisena omaisuutenaan; ja kun sitten  eräänä kauniina päivänä koko talo paloi perustuksiaan myöten, oli  hänellä puhdasta voittoa 24,000 dollaria. Siihen aikaan oli sillä paikkakunnalla omituinen klubi, jota sanottiin  »Maanpakolaisiksi». Sen useimmat jäsenet olivat hyvien perheiden  »nuorempia poikia» Englannista ja Britannian Canadasta, ihmisiä,  joilla oli enemmän tai vähemmän himmeä menneisyys, ihmisiä, jotka  olivat kotimaan onneksi ja tyynnyttääkseen asianomaisia siirtyneet  ulkomaille — onnenetsijöitä, pelaajia, huimapäitä, maankiertäjiä,  ihmisiä ylimyksellisine, niin, korkeimpaan aatelistoon kuuluvine  nimineen, jotka täällä liikkuivat salanimellä. Täällä hän tapasi  Billy Ishamin, joka kuului klubin johtokuntaan, tyhmänrohkean,  häikäilemättömän ja epäkäytännöllisen miehen. Heidän tuttavuutensa  sukeutui ystävyydeksi; kapteeni Jackin 24,000 dollarilla panivat  he alulle suuren kaappausyhtiönsä, sen jälkeen kun he olivat  San Franciscossa pitäneet välttämättömän kokouksen kapinallisten  asiamiehen, señora Estradon, kanssa. Kaiken tämän kertoi kapteeni eikä  unohtanut syrjäseikkaakaan, joka koski señoran käyntikorttia, jonka hän  oli repinyt kahtia ja antanut Ishamille toisen puolen. Sitten kertoi  hän heidän varustuksistaan ja rikkilyödystä sekstantista, joka aiheutti  kaikki heidän onnettomuutensa sekä heidän matkastaan yhtiökokoukseen  eräällä Panama-laivalla. »Sielun surma!» jatkoi kapteeni Jack, »olisittepa nähnyt Billy Ishamin  laivassa, tuossa taikinatiinuntapaisessa matkustajahöyrylaivassa.  Riittäköön kun sanon, että hän pani eloa sääriin keulasta perään asti.  Siellä laivassa oli saarnastuoli, jonka oli määrä mennä johonkin  kappeliin Mazatlanissa, ja tuo saarnastuoli oli tungettu peräkannelle.  No, Billy oli kokenut useampia hulluuksia elämässään, ja m.m. oli hän  myöskin ollut näyttelijä. Gaston Maundevilleksi sanoi hän itseään ja  oli ylettömän korskea Shakespearen teosten taidostaan ja kyvystään  tulkita mitä niissä oli luettavana rivien välissä. Minä en ikinä unohda  sitä päivää, jolloin hän piti Portian puheen meille. Me olimme juuri  kääntöpiirin alla, ja oli hehkuvan kuuma. Oli enimmäkseen vain miehiä  laivassa, ja me makasimme yltympäri kannella yöpukineissa, silloin  Billy — Gaston Maundeville — punasen valkojuovainen röijy yllään kömpi  tuohon suuremmoiseen saarnastuoliin kädessään laivan kirjastosta  peräisin oleva Shakespearen teos ja esitti meille: »Ei laupeuden luonto ole pakko,      se tihkuu taivaasta kuin sade leuto.» »Minä olin halkeamaisillani naurusta. Siunatkoon, kuinka me  virnistelimme hänelle! Ja jota enemmän me virnistelimme, ja jota  enemmän me pilkkasimme häntä, sitä vakavammaksi ja hurjemmaksi hän  tuli. Hän sanoi, että hän tulkitsi mitä oli rivien välissä.» Myöskin kertoi kapteeni koko tuon hurjan ja hullun jutun taistelusta  ja rakkaudesta, merirosvouksesta ja salaliitoista; mandolinit  näpähtelivät, veitset välkähteliväf, valat ja sonetit risteilivät;  valunut viini sekaantui valuneeseen vereen. Hän kertoi Ishamin ja  meksikkolaisen luutnantin kaksintaistelusta, jonka kuluessa he  vasemman käden ranteista yhteen sidottuina seisoivat ja pistelivät  toisiaan puukoilla; kolmekymmenlyönnistä pikimustassa pimeydessä  tullipakkahuoneen kellarissa; señora Estradan rakkaudesta Ishamiin; ja  koko tuon teoksessa »Viranomaisista huolimatta» äkkiä esiin vierivän ja  äkkijyrkästi vaihtuvan toiminnan. Lopulta iskivät Blixin pienet silmät ihan säkeniä; Condyn posket  hehkuivat; hänen kätensä olivat kylmät, ja hän vaihtoi yhtenään asentoa  niinkuin kiihtynyt, puhdasrotuinen hevonen. »Suuri Jumala, millainen kertomus!» hän melkein kuiskasi. Blix huokaisi pitkän, vapisevan henkäyksen, istahti mukavammin  kirstulle ja katsoi ympärilleen, niinkuin olisi hänet vasta unesta  herätetty. »Niin, kyllä», sanoi kapteeni ja kiersi itselleen savukkeen, »se oli  ihana aika. Käykääpä tuolla pitkin Keski-Amerikan rannikkoa olevissa  syrjäisissä tasavalloissa, niin saattepa nähdä, siellä sitä saa kokea.  Siinä on henki ja elämä kysymyksessä saada etusormi koukistetuksi  oikeaan aikaan; mitä tehdään, se tehdään perinpohjin. Jos vihataan  jotakuta, niin lojutaan valveilla koko yö ja purraan pielusta,  vain sitä varten että muistettaisiin kuinka perusteellisesti häntä  vihataan; ja jos rakastetaan naista — niin, suuri Jumala, kuinka häntä  rakastetaankaan!» »Mutta — mutta», huomautti Condy, »minä en voi käsittää kuinka te  sellaisten elämysten jälkeen voitte harrastaa mitään muuta.» »Minä en ole vielä kuollut enkä haudattu», vastasi kapteeni. »Arvelen  voivani keksiä toisen tai toisen tavan huvitellakseni vielä kerran.» »Kuinka voitte mukautua odottamaan yhtä ainoatakaan minuuttia?» kysyi  Blix henkeään pidättäen. »Minkä tähden te ette heti hanki laivaa ja  lähde uusille seikkailuille huomispäivänä?» »Ooh, se ei käy niin helposti nykyään», sanoi kapteeni ja puhalsi  savukkeen haiun ulos korvista. »Siihen on montakin syytä. Muun muassa  sentähden, että olen vasta viettänyt häitä.» X. »Häi-häitä!» haukotti Condy ja vaipui hieman kokoon. Blix hypähti ylös. »Oletteko te vasta viettänyt häitä ? kertasi hän vähän säikähtyneenä. »Ei — ei — no — sepä vasta oli hauskaa!» »Niin, niin», änkytti Condy. »Sehän oli hauskaa. Onneksi olkoon!» »Tulkaa kanssani sisälle — tulkaa kanssani», sanoi kapteeni hauskasti,  »niin minä esittelen teidät vaimolleni. Meidän häämme olivat viime  sunnuntaina.» »Ooh, kiitos, paljon kiitoksia — tulemme kernaasti — se on meistä  erinomaisen hauskaa», vakuuttivat molemmat salaliittolaiset  kuumeentapaisella sydämellisyydellä. »Hän on vietävän sievä, pieni nainen», selitti kapteeni ja sulki portin  heidän jälkeensä. Sitten kulki hän edellä hiekoitettua käytävää ylös  asemalle. »Sen kyllä uskon», vastasi Blix. Kapteeni Jackin leveän seljän takana  lähetti hän Condylle kehoittavan silmäyksen ja antoi hänelle tarmokkaan  sysäyksen käsivarrellaan saadakseen hänet taas tolalleen; Condy oli  aivan pyörällä; hän tuijotti tylsästi kapteenin niskaa ja hymyili  houkkamaisesti. »Taivaan tähden, Condy!» onnistui hänen kuiskata. Sitten olivat he  eteisessä. Onneksi saivat he minuutin tai pari tointuakseen, ennenkun he tulivat  sisään. Kapteeni Jack vei heidät jonkinlaiseen arkihuoneen ja konttorin  välillä olevaan suojaan ja pyysi heidät istumaan: »Olkaa nyt niinkuin kotonanne, niin minä käyn noutamassa vaimoni.» Niin pian kuin kapteeni Jack oli oven takana, kääntyivät he toistensa  puoleen. »Noh!» »Noh!» »Nyt me olemme kiikissä!» »Niin, ja siitä on nyt selviydyttävä, Condy. Olkaa vain niin  luonnollinen kuin mahdollista, niin ei ole mitään hätää.» »Mutta olettakaa, että hän tuntee meidät!» »Noh, entä sitten? Mutta kuinka he voisivat tietää, että me olemme  kirjoittaneet heidän kirjeensä?» »Hysh, Blix, elkää puhuko niin ääneen!» »Luuletteko heidän epäilevän jotakin?» »Nyt he tulevat.» »Olkaa kylmä, tyyni ja hillitty, Condy! Niin kaikki t käy hyvin.» »Olettakaahan, että se ei ole K.D.B.» Mutta se oli hän. Ja hän tunsi heidät heti. Hän ja kapteeni, joka  nauroi koko naamallaan, tulivat sisälle keittiön puolelta, K.D.B.  sirossa, sinisessä karttuunihameessa ja esiliinassa, joka oli  puhtauden, tärkkäyksen ja silityksen todellinen ihmenäyte. »Kas tässä, Kitty!» huudahti kapteeni Jack, uudestaan selittämättömän  iloisuuden valtaamana. »Tämä nuori pari on tullut tänne katsomaan  paikkaa, ja minä tahdoin että sinä saisit tervehtiä heitä. Herra Rivers  — tämä on minun vaimoni, Kitty, ja — anteeksi — neiti — minä en voi  oikein muistaa teidän nimeänne.» »Bessemer», sanoivat Condy ja Blix yhtä aikaa. »Ooh», huudahti K.D..B. »Tehän istuitte ravintolassa tuona iltana —  niin, niin, — olen varma siitä, että olen teidät ennen nähnyt.» Hän  kääntyi toisesta toiseen ja punastui yhä enemmän. »Aivan oikein, Lunan ravintolassa varmaan?» kysyi Condy epätoivon  uljuudella. »Olenpa minäkin sitä hiukan muistavinani.» »Niin, eikö kapteenikin ollut siellä?» uskalsi Blix kysyä. »Minä muistan, että unohdin keppini», jatkoi Condy. »Minun täytyi  palata sitä noutamaan, ja juuri kun olin poistumaisillani, olin  huomaavinani, että te molemmat istuitte yhdessä oven lähellä olevan  pöydän ääressä.» Hänestä oli viisainta, että hän oli ollut näkevinään heidät vasta  silloin. »Kyllä, niin oli», vastasi K.D.B. tahdikkaasti, »me tapaamme syödä  siellä maanantaisin.» Blix oletti, että K.D.B. mieluummin tahtoi päästä tilannetta lähemmin  selittämästä, ja päätti suoda hänelle mahdollisuuden vaihtaa ainetta. »Siellä on hyvää ruokaa», sanoi hän. »Niin, minä puolestani en voi sanoa, että ihailen espanjalaista  keittotaitoa», vastasi K.D.B., joka unohti, että he söivät siellä joka  maanantai. »Tavallinen amerikalainen on kyllin hyvää minulle.» Äkkiä kääntyi kapteeni Jack Condyn puoleen: »Ooh», sanoi hän,  »silloinpa te olitte se, joka sanoi taulun esittämää kuunaria soimaksi.» »Niin, eikö se sitten ollut soima», kysyi Condy viattomasti. »Itse voitte olla soima», sanoa läimähytti kapteeni. »Se oli kuunari,  se se oli, ja se oli selvä kuin tuo pihtipieli tuossa.» Mutta kymmenen minuuttia myöhemmin oli tulikoe kestetty, ja Blix  ja Condy hengittivät keveämmin jatkaessaan taas kulkuaan. Kapteeni  ja K.D.B. olivat molemmat saattaneet heidät veräjälle ja hartaasti  kehoittaneet heitä »pistäytymään sisälle seuraavalla kerralla, kun he  kulkivat tätä tietä.» »He ovat naimisissa!» ähki Condy ja kätki päänsä käsiinsä. »Ja se on  meidän syymme. Sitä ei saa koskaan enää tekemättömäksi.» »No, välikö tuolla?» selitti Blix hieman loukkaantuneena. »Minun  mielestäni ei siinä ole vähintäkään huomauttamisen varaa. Voittehan  nähdä, että kapteeni on rakastunut häneen ja K.D.B. kapteeniin. Minä en  voi ymmärtää, että meillä tässä asiassa on mitään kaduttavaa.» »Niin, mutta — niin äkkiä!» kuiskasi Condy aivan masentuneena. »Se on  se, joka on niin kauheata — niin äkkiä se on käynyt.» »Se osoittaa vain kuinka rakastunein he ovat ja kuinka — ja kuinka  mielellään he ovat — mukautuneet toisiinsa. Ei, se asia on aivan  niinkuin sen olla pitää.» »He näyttivät todellakin siltä, niinkuin he voisivat meistä pitää.» »Siihen heillä onkin syytä — jos he tietäisivät. Ellei meitä olisi  ollut, eivät he ikinä olisi toisiaan löytäneet». »Ja kumpikin pyysi meitä tulemaan heitä uudestaan tervehtimään,  panitteko te sen merkille? Menkäämme sinne toisenkin kerran, Blix.»  Condy oli taas äkkiä aivan ilostunut. »Eikö meidän teidänkin  mielestänne ole niin tehtävä?» »Kyllä, luonnollisesti. Olisi hyvin hauska mennä vierailulle heidän  luokseen — oppia heitä oikein tuntemaan!» »Saattaahan varsin hyvin tapahtua, että he pyytävät meitä jäämään  päivälliselle jonkun kerran.» »Niin, ja ajatelkaa sitten niitä kertomuksia, joita hän voi kertoa! Siinä on jotakin teille». He joutuivat molemmin puolin haltioihinsa näistä mahdollisuuksista,  puhuivat äänekkäästi yhtä aikaa ja tarkastivat yksityisiä kohtia  kapteenin kertomuksissa. »Ajatella vain!» huudahti Condy — »ajatella vain Billy Ishamia  puna-valkojuovaisessa yöpuvussaan lukien Shakespearea saarnastuolista  laivassa toisten maatessa ja virnistäessä hänelle ja nauraessa minkä  jaksavat. Se vasta on kohtaus, mitä? On kuin näkisi sen ilmielävänä.» »Eikö hän mahtanut keksiäkin yhtä ja toista? Hänellä ei näkynyt olevan  selvää käsitystä hyvästä ja pahasta. Se saattoi varsin hyvin olla  valetta kaikki tyyni.» »Niin, entä sitten?» sanoi Condy. Ja niin kulkivat he siellä tuona ihanana, kirkkaana aamupäivänä  pitkin mannermaan läntistä rannikkoa, nuorina ja elinvoimaisina  molemmat, ja Tyvenmeri, maailmankaupan tie, keinuili heidän, edessään  savupilareineen ja suolainen meri-ilma tuli pehmeästi aalloten ja  täytti heidän keuhkonsa. Nuorina, voimakkaina ja terveinä kulkivat he  siellä, mieli kuohuvan täynnä toimintaa ja seikkailuja, kaappauksia ja  merirosvousta, toisiaan risteileviä ajatuksia, lennossa ja nelistäen  läpi voimakkaan, rehevän elämän, halki todellisuuden rajattomasti  romantisen maailman. Ja aavistamatta sitä lainkaan, olivat he  itse puhdasta romantiikkaa. Epäilyksellä, vanhojen viisaudella ja  käsityksellä kaiken katoavaisuudesta ei ollut mitään sijaa siinä  maailmassa, jossa he kulkivat. Heillä oli vielä kuvittelunsa, heidän  aistinsa olivat tarkat, heidän vastaanottavaisuutensa elävä. Elämän  yksinkertainen juoksu, rodun leveät ja voimalliset tunteet liikkuivat  heissä. Heidän astuntansa oli täynnä joustavaa voimaa, he kulkivat alas  valtamerelle päin, tuskinpa he ajattelivat tai punnitsivat; he olivat  kuin kaksi kaunista, ystävällistä eläintä. He antautuivat kokonaan  hetken vaikutteihin; he eivät ajatelleet, he tunsivat. Heidän älynsä  nukahti; he näkivät, he kuulivat, he huomasivat suolaisen meren ja  touvien ja vesilätäköissä kasvavan lihavan, mausterikkaan krassin  hajun; he kylvettivät poskensa purjetuulessa ja hengittivät sitä  puoleksi avoimin suin ja laajennein sieraimin. Oli ihanaa elää; joka  tiima oli uutta autuasta huumausta. Se tosiasia, että meri oli sininen,  riitti saamaan heidät haltioihinsa. Pelkkä hengittäminen oli juhlaa.  He iloitsivat nuoruudestaan; ja kaikki oli nuorta heidän kanssaan —  päivä oli nuori, ja maa oli nuori, se sivistys, johon he kuuluivat,  se joka toimi täällä tämän leveän mannermaan viheriäisellä läntisellä  reunuksella, myöskin se oli uuden rodun kohisevan, punaisen veren  vaikutuksesta nuori ja reipas ja kapinallinen. Vieläpä Condy unohti tai oikeammin halveksi tänä päivänä yhdistää  ja järjestää kapteenin ryövärijuttuja novellinmuotoon. Meren ja  viheriäisten riuttojen ja Blixin rusottavien poskien katseleminen,  hänen keltaisten hiustensa liehunta hänen silmillään ja suullaan  oli parempaa kuin ajattelu. Elämä oli parempi kuin kirjallisuus.  Oli parempi elää kuin lukea. Elävä ihminen oli enemmän arvoinen  kuin kymmenentuhatta kuollutta Shakespearenlaista runoilijaa, teko  enemmän arvoinen kuin ajatus. Niin, vain rakastaa Blixiä, olla hänen  seurassaan, nähdä kuinka kauniisti hänen poskensa hehkuvat, tietää  hänen olevan niin lähellä, silloin tällöin töykätä hänen kyynäspäätään,  oli parempi kuin parhain romaani, kaunein kirja, minkä hän milloinkaan  saattoi toivoa saavansa kirjoitetuksi. Elämä oli kirjallisuutta  parempi, ja rakkaus oli elämän kruunu. Rakastaa Blixiä ja pitää hänet  lähellään - minkä muun puolesta sitä eläisi? Voiko hän milloinkaan  ajatellakaan mahdolliseksi, että hän löytäisi mitään niin kaunista ja  armasta ja rakasta kuin tämä yhdeksäntoistavuotias tyttö. Äkillinen loiskahdus sai Condyn takaisin todellisuuteen. Mitä hän kulki  ja uneksi? Mitä hän kulki ja kuvitteli? Rakastaa Blixiä? Rakastiko hän  Blixiä? Niin, luonnollisesti rakasti hän häntä — rakasti häntä niin,  että pelkkä ajatus siitä sai hänet haukkomaan henkeänsä ja täytti hänen  sydämensä oudolla hellyydentunteella, niin pehmeällä ja kuitenkin niin  voimakkaalla, ettei sille ollut sanoja eikä ilmaisumuotoja. Rakastiko  hän tyttöä? Kyllä, luonnollisesti rakasti hän Blixiä. Hän oli, itse  siitä tietämättä, rakastanut häntä jo kauan. Hän oli rakastanut  häntä tuona päivänä järvellä ja tuona unohtumattomana iltapäivänä  kiinalaisessa teehuoneessa; kaikkina noina pitkinä, hiljaisina  iltoina ruokasalin ikkunan ääressä, jossa he istuivat ja katselivat  hämärän läpi kaupungin yli; kaikkina noina iltoina oli hän rakastanut  häntä. Viimeisten kuukausien aikana oli joka päivä ollut täynnä hänen  rakkauttaan. Minkäpä takia hän muuten olisi näin onnellinen? Mikäpä muu hänet  vähitellen oli eroittanut tuosta mutkikkaasta seura-elämästä, jota  sellainen mies kuin Sargeant edusti? Mikäpä muu oli auttanut häntä  hitaasti päästämään irti pauloja, joilla tuo huono ja vahingollinen  tapa oli pitänyt hänet kiinni? Mikäpä muu oli herättänyt hänen  kunnianhimonsa? Mikäpä muu se oli, joka nyt karkasi hänen tähän asti  vapaasti liehuneen innostuksensa päättäväisyyteen ja toimintavoimaan?  Tytöllä ei aina ollut ollut sellaista vaikutusvaltaa häneen. Siihen  aikaan, jolloin he vain huvittelivat yhdessä seuraelämässä ja  näkivät toisensa seurustelutavan mukaisesti kerran viikossa, ei asia  ollut niin, vaikka heillä kyllä oli ollut olevinaan yhtä ja toista  ylijäämäksi toisilleen. Hän muisti sen illan, jolloin Blix oli tehnyt  pikaisen lopun niistä ajoista ja kuinka hän silloin heti oli mielessään  ajatellut, että kun kaikki kävi ympäri, niin ei hän sittenkään  ollut häntä koskaan oikein tuntenut. Mutta sitten oli kaikki tullut  toisenlaiseksi sen viehättävän uuden elämän kautta, jota he elivät. Hän  oli nyt elänyt. Hän oli oppinut tuntemaan hänet sellaisena kuin hän  oli, hänen sydämellisen hyvyytensä, rehellisen mielenlaatunsa, kuinka  hän halveksi kaikkea teeskentelyä, hänen toverillisuutensa ja hänen  järkkymättömän hyvälaatuisuutensa. Ja päivä päivältä, hiukan silloin ja  hiukan tällöin, oli hänen rakkautensa häneen kasvanut, niin tasaisesti,  niin hiljaa, ettei hän itse ollut huomannut sitä ennenkun nyt — nyt,  kun se äkkiä oli puhjennut täydessä kauneudessa ja voimassa, niinkuin  kukka, jonka tuoksu äkkiä tunkeutuu koko hänen elämäänsä ja koko hänen  maailmaansa suloudellaan. Puoli tuntia sen jälkeen, kun he olivat jättäneet pelastusaseman,  tulivat Blix ja Condy vanhalle linnoitukselle, joka ahavoituneine,  punaisine muurineen seisoi autiona ja unhotettuna Kultaisen portin  suulla. He kääntyivät kulmasta, ja siellä vieritti Tyvenmeri sinisiä,  monivivahteisia aaltojaan rajattomasti, ikuisesti yli maapallon, yli  maailman olan, ilman ainuttakaan purjetta näkyvissä, katkeamattomana  kaarena taivaanrannasta taivaanrantaan. He kulkivat nyt rannikkoa, milloin vanhaa aaltojen uurtamaa osaa  kukkuloiden alla, milloin alhaalla eturannalla, jossa he hyppäsivät  kiveltä kivelle tai juoksivat pitkin vedenrajaa kiinteillä valkoisilla  hiekkariutoilla. Ei ainoatakaan ihmistä näkynyt koko rannikolla. Maan puolella  kohoutuivat korkeat rinteet paljaina tai nurmipeittoisina kohti  taivasta, ja siellä täällä työntyivät ne ihan ulos veteen suurine  haljenneine ja rapeutuneine, märästä mustine kallionlohkareineen,  joiden juuria saartoi polvenkorkuinen, kuohuva vaahto. Ilma oli  täynnä aallokkojen pitkäveteistä jylinää, ja silloin tällöin tuli  merilintuja yksitellen ja parvissa kuppuroiden niiden yllä kimakasti  huutaen. Hylkykappaleita solui edes takaisin aaltojen mukana, ja  kokospähkinänkuoria, jotka olivat kuin suuria, ruskeita, kiskaistusta  kaarnasta tehtyjä maljoja, oli kasottain kallioiden juurella ja niiden  välisissä kuopissa. He löysivät maneetin — läpinäkyvän limaisen massan;  ja kerran osui heidän silmiinsä hyljekoira ärjy-aallon pohjassa; he  näkivät sen siloisen ja kiiltävän pään ja sen pingoitetut turpajouhet  ja kuulivat sen käheästi sähisevän haukunnan, kun se pitkin rantaa ajoi  takaa kalaa. Blix ei antanut Condyn vähintäkään auttaa itseään. Hän oli yhtä reipas  ja voimakas kuin Condy ja ryömi kalliolta kalliolle ja yli vedenrajassa  olevien pilaantuneiden ajopuiden, nopsana ja joustavana kuin nuori  poika. Hän vaipui liejuun kengänvarsia myöten, sai naarmuja käsiinsä  ja hameensa rikkirevityksi, niin, vieläpä hän nyrjäytti jalkansakin,  mutta hänen pienet silmänsä säteilivät yhtä pirteästi; hänen poskensa  rusottivat yhtä viehättävästi. Ja taukoamatta hän jutteli kaikesta mitä  näki, samantekevää oli, kuunteliko Condy vai ei. Milloin oli siinä  hullunkurinen kappale ruskolevää, milloin lokkiparvi, joka kinaili  kalasta, milloin purppuranvärinen meritähti, milloin tavattoman suuri  ärjy-aalto. Hänen valtava elonvoimansa tempasi hänet mukaansa. Hän oli  pelkkää elämää päästä kantapäähän, kaikkine aistineen aivan hereillä,  värisevän herkkä kaikille vaikutelmille. »Nouskaamme tästä ylös ja levätkäämme hetkinen», ehdotti Condy. He jättivät rannan ja kipusivat ylös rinnettä sellaisella kohdalla,  jossa esiinpistävä töyry antoi suojaa; siellä tapasivat he polun, joka  vei heidät alas pieneen, tyyneen vuorenkattilaan, jonka sivuilla kasvoi  mustikanvarsia. Täällä he istahtivat. Blix asettui vanhalle puunjuurelle mielihyvästä  huokaisten, ja Condy oikasihe pitkäkseen vastatäytetty piippu  hampaissaan ja niska pientä käsilaukkua vasten, jota hän koko päivän  oli niin uskollisesti kantanut. Sitten kävi Blix äkkiä hiljaiseksi;  ja kauan istuivat he siinä kumpikin äänettöminä katsellen valtavia  viheriäisiä vuoria, jotka viettivät alas mereen, pitkin rantaa kuohuvia  ärjy-aaltoja, rikkimurskaantuneita kallioita, ääretöntä merenpintaa ja  näköalaa yli vanhan linnoituksen Kultaisen portin suulle. »Voisimmepa olla sata penikulmaa kaupungista, siitä päättäen mitä  me nyt näemme. Emmekö voisikin, Condy?» sanoi Blix viimein. »Ja te  ette voi tietää, kuinka nälkä minulla on. Nyt on varmaankin jo  päivällisaika.» Vastaukseksi nousi Condy hyvin arvokkaasti ylös, aukaisi ihailtavalla  huolimattomuudella käsilaukun ja otti sieltä esille, kenkien asemesta,  ensin kokonaisen pullon punaviiniä, sitten kinkkuvoileipiä, voipaperiin  käärittyinä, tölkin keitettyjä oliiveja, suuren pussin suolatuita  manteleita, kaksi pientä lasia, romaanin ja huuliharpun. Blix melkein huusi ihastuksesta, löi polviaan ja keinui edestakaisin  puunjuurellaan. »Ei, Condy, oletteko te todellakin pitänyt huolta aamiaisesta —  siinäpä vasta on hienoja kenkiä! Ja te muistitte, että oliivit ovat  minun lempiruokani! Ja sitten vielä kirjakin, katsoppa vain! Mikä se  on? ’Seitsemän valtamerta’. Ei, tämäpä on parasta, missä minä olen  ollut mukana. Mutta tuo huuliharppu — mitä varten se on?» »Soitettavaksi. Te ehkä luulitte sitä ruuviavaimeksi?» Blix tärisi  ihastuksesta hänen tyhmän sukkeluutensa takia, ja Condy lisäsi ylpeästi: »Huomatkaa, että minä itse olen kaiken järjestänyt!» »Sen kyllä huomaa: suuret paksut perunat kuorineen, kinkku paksuina  viipaleina niiden välissä ja sitten olitte totta tosiaan levittänyt  voita leivälle.» Mutta siitä he eivät välittäneet. He söivät  kuninkaallisen aterian, vieläpä Blix otti hattunsakin päästään ja  ripusti sen vieressään olevaan pensaaseen. Mutta luonnollisesti oli  Condy unohtanut korkkioran. Ponnistaessaan epätoivoisesti saadakseen  punaviinipullon korkin kaivetuksi ylös taittoi hän taskuveitsensä  molemmat terät ja oli jo toivottomana heittää koko avaamisen kesken,  kun Blix kärsimättömästi otti pullon ja etusormellaan työnsi korkin  alas. »Viiniä, soittoa, juhla-ateria ja runoutta», sanoi Condy. »Me laukeamme  suureen ylellisyyteen niinkuin Sardanapalus.» Mutta Condy oli itse äkkiä joutunut sellaiseen onnen ilmapiiriin,  jonka vertaista hän ei koskaan ollut tuntenut. Hän rakasti Blixiä.  Hän rakasti häntä sentähden, että hän oli niin aito, niin säteilevän  terve ja voimakas; hän rakasti häntä, koska Blix piti samasta kuin  hän, siksi, että he katsoivat olemassa-oloa samalta näkökannalta,  inhosivat teeskentelyä ja teennäisyyttä, iloitsivat kaikesta suorasta,  rehellisestä ja luonnollisesta. Hän rakasti tyttöä sentähden, että  tämä piti hänen kirjoistaan, pani arvoa samoille piirteille niissä  kuin hänkin ja moitti sitä mitä hänkin paheksui. Hän rakasti tyttöä  sentähden, että tämä oli yhdeksäntoistavuotias ja sentähden, että  tämä oli niin nuori ja turmeltumaton ja saattoi iloita sinisestä  merestä ja kauniista aamusta. Hän rakasti tyttöä hänen kauneutensa,  hänen keltaisten hiustensa pehmeyden, hänen kaarevan, valkean  otsansa ja hänen pienten tummanruskeiden silmiensä takia, silmien,  jotka aina näyttivät siltä kuin hän juuri olisi nauramaisillaan tai  olisi nauranut; hän rakasti tyttöä hänen lujan suunsa ja leukansa,  hänen korkeaan valkoiseen atlassinauhaan kiedotun pyöreän kaulansa  takia. Ja hän rakasti tyttöä sentähden, että tämän käsivarret olivat  voimakkaat ja kaunismuotoiset ja että hän pyöreällä vyötäröllään  käytti suurta koirankaulanauhaa, ja sentähden, että hänen melkein joka  pienimmästäkin liikkeestään lähti tuo tuskin huomattava mutta lumoava  naisellisuuden tuoksu, tuo tuoksu, joka osaksi johtui hajuvedestä,  mutta kuitenkin enimmäkseen oli hänen suunsa, hänen hiustensa, hänen  kaulansa, hänen käsivarsiensa ja koko hänen miellyttävän olentonsa  hienoa, määräämätöntä ja sanomattoman tenhoavaa aroomia. Ja hän  rakasti tyttöä sentähden, että tämä oli se mikä hän oli, että hän  oli Blix, sen äärettömän suloisen voiman takia, joka hänestä lähti  näinä hiljaisina hetkinä, kun hän tunsi hänen olevan niin lähellä, ja  jonkinlainen nimetön ja arvoituksellinen kuudes aisti heräsi hänessä  ja kertoi hänelle kuinka hyvä, ystävällinen ja puhdas ja naisellinen  hän oli; ja tuo epämääräinen hellyyden tunne etsi häntä, hellyys, joka  ei kohdistunut ainoastaan häneen, vaan kaikkeen hyvään maailmassa; ja  hänen oman luonteensa jaloimmat puolet tulivat esille ja vaativat olla  hänessä olevan parhaimman kanssa samalla tasolla. Hän katseli tyttöä salaa, kun tämä istui tuossa hänen vieressään,  keltaiset hiukset lainehtien ja liehuen otsan ympärillä, kädet helmassa  merelle miettiväisenä katsellen avoimin silmin. Hän oli sanonut, ettei hän rakastanut häntä. Condy muisti sen hyvin.  Se oli hänen vilpitön ajatuksensa; hän ei rakastanut häntä. Se aihe  oli kerta kaikkiaan karkoitettu heidän väliltään. Ja juuri sentähden  oli heidän toveruutensa näinä viimeisinä kolmena neljänä kuukautena  ollut niin viehättävä. Hän piti häntä hyvänä ystävänä. Hän oli  muuttumattomasti sama kuin sillä kerralla, mutta hän — niin, hänelle  oli maailma tullut ihan uudeksi tänään! Niin, siihen määrään rakasti  hän häntä, niin rakkaaksi oli hän käynyt hänelle, että kun hän vain  ajatteli häntä, paisui ja hypähteli sydän hänen rinnassaan. Mutta kaikki tämä täytyi hänen pitää omana tietonaan. Jos hän sanoisi  jotakin, antaisi tytön tietää kuinka syvästi hän tätä rakasti, olisi  kaikki tuhottu, tuossa tuokiossa olisi heidän toveruutensa lopussa.  Siitä he olivat molemmat selvillä; he olivat koettaneet tuota toista,  se ei käynyt. Rakastavina olivat he saaneet tarpeeksi toisistaan;  tovereina olivat he sopineet mainiosti yhteen, ollen kokonaan ja  esteettömästi onnellisia. Condy puri hampaansa yhteen. Se oli kylläkin kovaa. Hänen oli  valittava, joko tehdä loppu heidän viehättävästä toveruudestaan tai  myöskin varoa millään tavalla ilmaisemasta rakkauttaan, pakoittaa ja  vallita sitä, ja tehdä se samalla, kun joka hermo hänessä värisi kuin  viulunkieli jousen alla. Ei ollut hänen luonteenlaatunsa mukaista  rakastaa hiljaa ja rauhallisesti tai etäältä; hän tahtoi tuntea hänen  käsiään, hänen viileää, pehmeää poskeansa ja hengittää hänen hiustensa  tuoksua, tuntea hänen huulensa omiaan vasten ja peittää kasvonsa hänen  helmaansa. »Mikä teidän on, Condy?». Blix katseli häntä levottomasti. »Minkätähden te rypistätte otsaanne niin ankarasti ja puristatte  kätenne nyrkkiin. Te olette myöskin kalpea. Onko jotakin hullusti?» Hän heitti Blixiin nopean silmäyksen ja hillitsi itsensä. »Tämäpä on hauska, pieni soppi, tämä», sanoi hän. »Mutta kuulkaahan, Blix, kuinka pitkä aika on siihen, kun te matkustatte?» »Huomisesta kuusi viikkoa.» »Ja sitten olette te poissa neljä vuotta — neljä vuotta! Kenties te  ette koskaan palaja. Kuka tietää mitä voi tapahtua neljän vuoden  kuluessa. Missä se hullu huuliharppu on?» Huuliharppu oli täynnä leivänmurusia ja muuta sellaista. Condy ei  voinut sillä soittaa. Kaikki hänen vaivansa palkittiin vain suhisevalla  äänellä, kuolemankorahduksilla, surkealla ulvonnalla. Hän heitti sen  mereen. »No missä sitten on se hullu kirja?» sanoi hän. »Te istutte sen päällä,  Blix, kas tässä, lukekaa nyt ääneen. Avatkaa vain kirja miltä kohdalta  tahansa.» »Ei, se on teidän tehtävä.» »Eipä suinkaan, enkö minä kenties ole jo tehnyt tarpeeksi? Enkö minä ostanut . kirjan ja huolehtinut ruuasta, enkö minä laittanut voileivät  ja maksanut raitiovaunun? Tämä retki tulee maksamaan liki pitäen 3  dollaria, ennenkun me olemme kotona. Tiedättekö mitä; vähin mitä te  voitte tehdä, on että luette hiukan ääneen minulle. Mutta voimmehan  lyödä siitä arpaa.» Condy onki taskustaan kymmensenttisen ja Blix otti neljännesdollarin  kukkarostaan. »Heittäkää minun puolestani», pyysi hän. Condy heitti ja sai kruunun. Kun hän otti kirjan, sanoi Blix: »Sen, jolla on niin tavattoman huono onni kuin teillä, on melkein  mieletöntä pelata uhkapeliä. Minä en ole vielä koskaan pelannut yhtään  erää pokeria teidän kanssanne voittamatta joka shillinkiä, joka teillä  oli taskussa.» »Niin! Mutta mitä teette kaikilla noilla rahoilla?» »Annan niiden luistaa», vastasi hän ylimielisesti, »hansikkaihin,  harsoihin ja hattuneuloihin — kaikenmoiseen.» Mutta Condy saattoi kuulla, ettei ollut totta, mitä Blix sanoi. Runsaan tunnin istui Condy nyt ja luki ääneen hänelle teoksesta  »Seitsemän valtamerta», tuulen suhistessa hiljaa yli valtavain,  paljaiden särkkien ja leikkiessä suopursun lehtien ja suurien  mustikkamarjapensaiden kanssa kuiluissa, ja ärjy-aaltojen tullessa  jylisten ja vetäytyessä taas kalisten takaisin yli rantaäyrään siellä  alhaalla ja vesilintujen lennellessä heidän yllään. Blix kuunteli tarkkaavaisesti, mutta Condyn olisi ollut mahdoton  selostaa sitä mitä hän juuri oli lukenut. Parempi oli elää kuin  lukea; elämä oli kirjallisuutta arvokkaampi, ja hänen uudessa, vasta  keksimässään rakkaudessa oli hänelle runoutta kylliksi. Hän jatkoi  lukemistaan, ettei hän voisi katsoa Blixiin ja sanoa enemmän kuin  tahtoi. Liki liippasi toisinaan, ettei hän keskeyttänyt lukemistaan  ja puhunut suutaan puhtaaksi toisen petollisen minän valtaamana,  huolimatta lujasta tahdostaan. Hän ei ollut koskaan elämässään ollut  niin onnellinen, vaan ei myöskään niin onneton. Hän alkoi livetä  sanoihin ja hyppiä yli kokonaisten rivien ja lauseiden, niin, käänsipä  hän pari lehteäkin kerrallaan. »Sepä oli komea rivi», huudahti Blix. »Mikä rivi? Mistä te puhutte? Kuulkaa, Blix, tätä päivää emme saa  koskaan unohtaa. Luvatkaamme, kävi miten kävi ja olimmepa missä  tahansa, että aina kirjoitamme toisillemme tänä päivämääränä. Onko tämä  lupaus?» »Kyllä, minä lupaan. Ja nyt — — —» »Minä lupaan sen kaikesta sydämestäni. Ei, te voitte olla aivan varma,  minä en sitä unohda, en — — Niin kuin sanottu, tämä on lupaus.  Tänäänhän minä olen… Blix, minne tuo merkillinen kirja joutui?» »Condy.» »Niin, se otettiin minulta pois. Te istutte kaiketikin taas sen päällä. Mutta viisi kirjasta! Lähdemme ehkä mieluummin nyt.» »Siitä tulee pitkä kävely ennenkun olemme kotona. Eikö liene parasta  että syömme Lunassa?» »Te olette pahin tuhlari minkä tunnen. Luuletteko te minua  koronkiskuriksi. Minulla ei ole enään kuin kolmeneljännesdollaria  jälellä. Paljonko teillä on?» Blixillä oli kukkarossaan 35 centtiä, ja he pohtivat rahallista asemaa  hyvin perusteellisesti. Se riitti kahdelle raitiovaunupiletteihin ja  »meksikkolaiseen illalliseen», ja sitten jäi vielä 10 centtiä yli. »Richardille», sanoi Blix. »Sikaariksi minulle», sanoi Condy. »Te saitte minut antamaan hänelle puoli dollaria. Se oli vähin minkä  saatoin antaa, sanoitte te — aateluus velvoittaa.» »No, siinä sen nyt itse näette; minä en voi antaa hänelle vain 10  centtiä. Minä sanon vain, että me olemme puhtaaksi kynityt täksi  päiväksi.» He lähtivät menemään, ei samaa tietä, vaan yli törmien ja sitten  suoraan poikki avonaisen, viheriän niityn, joka komeili sinisine  kurjenmiekkoineen, valkoisine heliotrooppeineen, keltaisine  unikkoineen ja orvokkeineen siellä täällä. Sitten tulivat he eräälle  kenttävallitielle, joka oli punainen ja tasainen kuin kamarin lattia.  Ja eräässä kulmassa, jossa tie teki jyrkän käänteen kohti kaupunkia,  pysähtyivät he hetkiseksi ja katselivat taakseen ihanata näköalaa,  valtamerta, puolikuunmuotoista maisemaa ja sitten etualalla aaltoilevia  vuoria, jotka ulottuivat alas rantaan ja olivat aivan täpö täynnä  metsäkukkia. Neljännestunnin kuluttua olivat he golfradalla. »Me menemme suoraan yli», sanoi Condy, »ja otamme ensimäisen  raitiovaunun toisella puolen.» He menivät tieltä ja oikaisivat suoraan yli radan, Condy piippu  suussa. Mutta samassa kun he kulkivat ohi pitkän eucalyptuspuu-rivin  sen paikan läheisyydessä, mistä pallopeli aletaan, kuulivat he äkkiä  varoitushuudon: »Pitäkää varanne siellä!» Condy ja Blix katsoivat äkkiä ylös, ja siellä eräässä ryhmässä, ei  kymmentä kyynärää heistä, näkivät he nuoren Sargeantin ja hänen  sisarensa ja pari muuta heidän piiriinsä kuuluvaa nuorta naista sekä  Jack Carterin puettuina homespuniin ja polvihousuihin, lyhyihin  soreihin golfnuttuihin ja skotlantilaisiin kauluksiin, täydessä  touhussa lyöntinuijineen. XI. Kun kello klubin kirjastossa löi kaksitoista, pani Condy kynän pois,  työnsi tiheästi kirjoitetut arkit kauemmaksi pöydällä ja nojautui  taapäin tuolissaan kädet painettuina väsyneitä silmiä vasten. Hän  istui kirjoituspulpetin ääressä salin perällä viheriäisen japanilaisen  varjostimen suojassa. Hän oli paitahihasillaan, tukka pörröllään,  sormet musteessa, jotakuinkin kalpea. Hän oli kirjoittanut herkeämättä koko illan. Kolme lukua  »Viranomaisista huolimatta» oli valmiina, ja nyt oli hän paraillaan  kirjoittamassa neljättä. Päivää sen jälkeen, kun he olivat tehneet  retken linnoitukselle — hänen uuden olentonsa eriskummallisena  syntymäpäivänä — oli hänelle äkkiä valjennut, että kapteenin kertomus  kullankaivajaravintolasta, »Maanpakolaiset»-nimisestä klubista  ja kaappausretkestä juuri olisi se jännittävä romaani, josta  Riemukustannusliike oli puhunut. Hän oli heti käynyt siihen käsiksi,  täynnä innostusta, ja hammasta purren oli hän luvannut itselleen,  ettei häneltä tulisi puuttumaan tarmoa. Hänen täytyi suorittaa tämä  työ vapaa-aikanaan, toisin sanoen hänen täytyi käyttää illat siihen.  Ja niin hän oli tehnytkin. Nyt oli hän kohta jo istunut viikon  kirjoituspöytänsä ääressä tässä klubin tyvenessä komerossa joka ilta  kello kahdeksan ja sitkeästi jatkanut työtään sydänyöhön asti. Kaksi ensimäistä lukua oli syntynyt kuin itsestään — niiden  kirjoittaminen oli oikeaa nautintoa. Kolmas tuotti enemmän vaivaa,  toiminta hämmentyi, toinen piirre vastusti toista. Billy Isham  kieltäytyi itsepintaisesti asettumasta sille huomatulle paikalle, johon  Condy oli hänet määrännyt; ja nyt, neljännen luvun alussa, oli Condy  vihdoinkin perinpohjin tutustunut niihin määrättömiin vaikeuksiin,  niihin toivottomiin mutkikkaisuuksiin, masentaviin keksintöihin, joita  joka vaiheessa ilmeni, voittamattomiin esteisiin, kidutuksiin, vaivaan,  aivojen kulutukseen ja kalvaviin huoliin, joista ei kukaan suurempien  teosten tekijä säästy. Kirjoittaa lyhyt kertomus alun pitäen näkyvissä olevine päämäärineen  oli helppo asia verrattuna siihen, että graani graanilta, atoomi  atoomilta rakentaa luonnosta teoksen »Viranomaisista huolimatta».  Condy oli pian selvillä siitä, ettei hänellä ollut käytettävänä kuin  yksi keino. Hän ei saisi ollenkaan ajatella kertomuksen päättämistä  — tuota kaukaista ja korkeaa päämäärää — vaan hänen piti luoda teos  luku luvulta, niin, lause lauseelta; puristaa se väkisin esiin, niin  sanoakseni; ajaa kynä eteenpäin rivistä riviin, tuntuipa työ kuinka  raskaalta tahansa; hänen tuli tyytyä siihen, että silloin tällöin sai  luvun valmiiksi; hänen piti olla työssä tunti tunnin, minuutti minuutin  jälkeen, takoa sitä kylmästi, veriin syöpyneen ankarasti ja kestävästi  niinkuin kaleriorja, jota ruoska uhkaa. Toisinaan ajoi kertomus kiveen, suorastaan kuin uhalla. Oli  fyysillisesti mahdotonta kirjoittaa sanaakaan enään; hänen aivonsa  eivät sitä sallineet. Condy saattoi istua kokonaisen tunnin ja  enemmänkin ja tuijottaa puoleksi valmiita sivua, pureksia kynsiä, repiä  tukkaa, kastaa kynää mustetolppoon, rajoittaa koko maailmansa tähän  paperiarkkiin — mutta yhtä vähän se auttoi. Hänellä ei ollut pienintäkään nautintoa työstä. Niin pian kun  joku luonne oli kiintynyt hänen mieleensä, joku kohtaus piirtynyt  hänen mielikuvitukseensa, oli myöskin luonne menettänyt uutuuden  viehätyksensä, kohtaus ensimmäisen mielijohteen raikkauden, ennenkun  hän oli kirjoittanut sanaakaan. Sitten täytyi hänen tavattomalla  vaivalla, melkein yliluonnollisella kärsivällisyydellä hitaasti  rakentaa suunnitelmaansa, jonka ääriviivat olivat näyttäytyneet niin  selvästi hänelle haihtuvassa aivovalossa. Kaikki oli ahertamista,  kovaa, vastenmielistä ja väsyttävää ahertamista; eivät mitkään kauniit  korulauseet, ei mikään väärä »luomisen ilon» ajatus voinut järkyttää  tätä tosiseikkaa. »Minkätähden», mumisi hän ja nousi ylös taittaen  käsikirjoituksen ja ottaen takin ylleen, »minkätähden teen minä niin?  Niin, minä en sitä tiedä.» Ei ollut epäilemistäkään, että Condy kolme kuukautta varemmin heti  olisi heittänyt sikseen tämän vastenmielisen ja vaivaloisen homman.  Mutta Blix oli tehnyt hänestä toisen miehen. Äkillinen miehuudenvoima  oli alkanut kehittyä Condyssä. Voimakas tunne oli puistanut häntä, hän  oli alkanut nähdä ja tuntea elämän vakavan, enemmän todellisen ja ehkä  myöskin ankaramman puolen. Blix oli antanut hänelle enemmän lyijyä  taian alle, sitä ei käynyt kieltäminen. Hän ei ollut enää juuri sama  nulikkamainen poika, joka kolme kuukautta sitten oli »tehnyt itsensä  narriksi» kiinalaisessa teetalossa. Kun Condy tuli kadulle, oli viimeinen raitiovaunu mennyt. Hän meni  jalkaisin kotiin, ja heittäytyi vuoteelle ajattelemisesta väsyneenä,  lamautunein hermoin ja sellaisin tuntein kuin olisi hänen verensä  kerääntynyt aivoihin. Hän huomasi, että häntä rasitti näin työskennellä  myöhään yöhön kokopäiväisen kirjoittamisen jälkeen. Sekä tämä väsymys että seurusteleminen Blixin kanssa oli vähitellen  vetänyt Condyn pois hänen vanhasta piiristään. Hän kieltäytyi toisesta  iltakutsusta toisen jälkeen, ja kun hän ennen oli tavannut syödä  aamiaista klubilla yhdessä Sargeantin tai Handsin kanssa, niin oli hän  nyt tottunut syömään aamiaista Blixin luona Washington-Streetillä ja  viettämään lomansa keskipäivällä hänen seurassaan. Condyn karkaamista pohdittiin usein tuossa hänen entisessä  tuttavallisessa klubiseurassaan, ja sattumalta tuli asia taas esille  eräänä iltapäivänä, kun Jack Carter oli klubissa George Handsin  vieraana. Hands, Carter ja Eckert istuivat erään ikkunan ääressä  poltellen sikaareja ja juoden likööriä päivällisen jälkeen. »Kuulkaahan!» sanoi äkkiä Eckert, »kuka on tuo nuori nainen tuolla  toisella puolen katua — joka juuri nyt menee turkkurin ikkunan ohi?  Olen varma siitä, että olen nähnyt hänet ennen jossakin. Eikö teistä  kukaan tiedä kuka hän on?» »Kyllä, eikö se ole neiti Bessemer?» sanoi Hands ja kumartui eteenpäin  katsomaan. »Hän on turkasen kaunis, sitä hän on!» »Kyllä, se on Travis Bessemer», vakuutti Jack Carter. Vähän myöhemmin  hän lisäsi: »On vahinko tyttöä.» »Vahinko… mitä?» kysyi Eckert. Carter kohautti olkapäitään. »Niin, minä en tiedä mitään. Mutta mistä johtunee, että paremmat  perheet ovat lakanneet seurustelemasta hänen kanssaan. Ennenhän hän oli  aina mukana.» »Niin, nyt muistan, minä en todellakaan ole nähnyt häntä enää tänä  huvikautena», sanoi Eckert. »Mutta minä olen kuullut, että hän  itse vetäytyi pois seuraelämästä, hänen piti lähteä itään päin —  opiskelemaan lääketiedettä, luullakseni.» »Sehän on vanha asia», huomautti Carter hymyillen, »että heti kun joku  nainen on suljettu pois seurasta, alkaa hän etsiä työalaa elämässä  vakavasti ja niin poispäin.» »Mitä te sillä tarkoitatte?» murisi George Hands. »Travis Bessemeriä ei  ole suljettu pois seurasta.» »Sitä en ole sanonutkaan», vastasi Carter, »vaan hän on antanut  ihmisille jota kuinkin paljon puheen aihetta viime aikoina. Joka  tapauksessa on varomatonta, että hän niin paljon juoksee Riversin  kanssa. Ei sillä, että siinä olisi mitään pahaa, mutta siitä puhutaan.  Minä satuin itse yhteen heidän kanssaan eräässä pensaikossa tuolla  radalla viime — —-» »Niin», pisti Sargeant väliin ja nojautui Carterin tuolin selustaan,  »aivan niin. Minä näin, että te olitte hänelle vain tyhjää ilmaa. —  Olisittepa vain ollut siellä», jatkoi hän hilpeästi ja kääntyi toisten  puoleen. »Siinä meni teiltä hukkaan pieni sievä kohtaus. Rivers ja  neiti Bessemer olivat tehneet kiertoretken kenttävalleille — siellä  kuuluu muuten olevan suurenmoista kävellä, sanoo sisareni; hän ja Dick  Forsythe tapaavat olla siellä aamukävelyllä joka lauantai — noo, Rivers  ja neiti Bessemer juoksivat aivan odottamatta eteemme. Me olimme kaikki  puetut uusimman golfmuodin mukaan, ja arvaan että muistutimme enemmän  myymäläikkunoiden näytenukkeja kuin ihmisiä, jotka olivat ulkona  urheilemassa. Rivers ja neiti Bessemer sitävastoin olivat kunnollisesti  olleet jalkamatkalla; he näyttivät kulkeneen ainakin neljä penikulmaa  aamupuhteella, ja he olivat vanhoissa vaatteissaan, pölyisinä ja  tahriintuneina. »Eipä olisi todellakaan ollut ihme, jos neiti Bessemer, joka on niin  nuori, olisi tullut hieman hämilleen osuessaan äkkiä niin loistavan  hienoon seuraan kuin meidän. Mutta ei merkkiäkään siitä, että hän  olisi joutunut tasapainosta. Hän nyökkäsi sisarelleni ja minulle,  totta tosiaan, niinkuin olisi hän istunut vaunuissa neljä hevosta  edessä ja niinkuin olisi ollut juuri Redfernin ja Virotin valmistamissa  pukineissa. Se osoittaa kulttuuria, näette. Eikä hän edes unohtanut  antaa tälle meidän kiltille pikku Carterillemme kelpo läksytystä,  sentähden että Carter juovuspäissään oli häntä kohtaan tunkeileva  eräänä iltana tanssiaisissa. Eikö olekin totuuden kanssa yhtäpitävää  — Johnni? Johnni meni hänen luokseen tuolla radalla ja ojensi hänelle  kätensä: ’Ei, kas hyvää päivää, neiti Bessemer! Mistä ihmeestä te  tulette? — Siitä on kauan, kun teidät viimeksi näin.’ Johon hän  vastasi: ’Mikäli minä tiedän, ette sen koommin kuin tanssimme yhdessä,  herra Carter', ja sitten katsoi hän hänen kättään, niinkuin hän ei  olisi käsittänyt, mitä sillä siinä oli tekemistä. »Pikku Johnni änkytti ja punastui ja peräytyi heti kiireimmän kautta.  Ja siinä hän teki viisaasti, sillä Rivers oli alkanut saada höyryn  nousemaan. Ei, se tyttölapsi on oikeata lajia, sen minä takaan, ja  minun sisareni aikoo pitää kutsut hänen kunniakseen, heti kun neiti  Bessemer vain suostuu ottamaan kutsut vastaan. Mutta nyt, kun Johnni  sanoo, että hänet on suljettu pois seurasta, on kai viisainta, että  sisareni vielä harkitsee asiaa.» »Minä en sanonut että hänet on suljettu pois», väitti Carter. »Sanon  vain, että hänen pitäisi olla vähän varovaisempi.» Sargeant siirsi sikaarin toiseen suupieleen ja nipisti kiinni toisen  silmänsä välttääkseen sikaarinhaikua. »Sitä voisi sanoa useammasta», vastasi hän. »Kylläpä käytätte suurta suuta minua vastaan?» kiivaili Carter. »Menkää hornaan, Johnni! Emmekö ota jotakin juotavaa?» Saman viikon perjantai-iltana istuutui Condy tavalliseen aikaan  yksityistyöhönsä. Mutta hänellä oli ollut kova päivä toimituksessa ja  aivot olivat kankeat kuin väsynyt hevonen. Puolessa tunnissa ei hän  saanut lausettakaan kirjoitetuksi. »Arvelin olevan parasta antaa työn levätä tänä ainoana iltana», selitti  hän Blixille kahtakymmentä minuuttia myöhemmin, kun he istuivat  pienessä ruokahuoneessa, »niin sujuu huomenna paremmin. Katsotaanpa nyt  mitä te pidätte viimeisestä luvusta.» Blix oli ihastunut tähän »Viranomaisista huolimatta». Condy oli antanut  hänelle viittauksia pääpiirteistä ja lukenut hänelle luvun toisensa  jälkeen sitä myöten, kun hän sai ne valmiiksi. »Se on parasta mitä te milloinkaan olette kirjoittanut, Condy, ja  sen te kaiketi itsekin tiedätte. Siinä on arvattavasti virheitä,  mutta niistä minä en hituistakaan välitä. Itse toiminta se  on, joka kiinnittää mieltä. Ken on lukenut ensimmäisen luvun  kullankaivajakapakasta ja Maanpakolaisten klubista, tahtoo kyllä  jatkaa. Te luotte paraillaan tulevaa mestariteostanne, ja te onnistutte  siinä myöskin.» »Se on tuo samanaikainen sanomalehteen kirjoittaminen, joka tekee  minusta pelkän töhrijän. Te ette voi aavistaakaan miltä tuntuu ryhtyä  taas iltasella kirjoittamaan, kun on koko päivän kirjoittanut.» »Niin, kunpa te vain pääsisitte tuosta sanomalehdestä eroon», sanoi  Blix. »Te käytätte parhaat vuotenne ammattityöhön, ja nyt se vielä  päälle päätteeksi haittaa teidän runoilemistanne. Minä olen varma  siitä, että kertomuksenne siitä kostuisi, jos te pääsisitte vapaaksi  sanomalehtiahertelusta. Ettekö te ole itsekin samaa mieltä?» »Kyllä, te olette aivan oikeassa. Työni sujuisi varmasti paremmin»,  vastasi hän. »Mutta ne eivät tahdo antaa minulle lomaa. Minä kyselin  sitä toissapäivänä toimittajalta. Ei, minä olen pakoitettu suorittamaan  kummankin työn yhtä aikaa.» »Emme huoli nyt puhua asioista. Te tarvitsette lepoa. Haluatteko pelata  erän pokeria?» He pelasivat tunnin verran, ja Condy hävisi tapansa nuukaan. Hänen  huono onnensa oli kerrassaan hämmästyttävä. Kahden viimeksi kuluneen  kuukauden aikana oli hän pelannut pokeria Blixin kanssa kolme neljä  kertaa viikossa, ja joka kerta oli Blix voittanut. Hän oli nyt oppinut pelaamaan yhtä hyvin ellei paremminkin kuin Condy.  Hän saattoi melkein joka kerta sanoa, milloin Condyllä oli hyvät  kortit kädessä, samalla kun hän säläsi oman asemansa läpäisemättömän  välinpitämättömin ilmein. »Montako haluatte ostaa?» kysyi Condy ja väisteli. »Minä seison.» »Sepä vasta —» vastasi hän hämmästyneenä. »Minä otan kolme.» »Passi»,  jatkoi Blix kylmäverisesti. »Hyvä. Katsotaanpa — minä panen viisi.» »Kaksikymmentä lisää.» Condy tarkasti korttinsa, pani ne pois ja otti ne taas käteensä. Sitten  hän heitti pöydälle kaksi korkeaa ristikorttia. »Ei», sanoi hän, »niitä en pelaa. Mutta mitä teillä on? Katsotaanpa  vain huvin vuoksi.» Blix levitti korttinsa pöydälle. »Teillähän ei ole rahtuakaan!» huudahti Condy. »Olisihan minun pitänyt  se tietää. Mutta tuossa hävisi viimeinen dollarini. Lainatkaa minulle  50 centtiä, Blix.» Blix pudisti päätään. »Sellainen pieni saituri!» sanoi Condy harmistuneena. »Te saatte  takaisin koko summan.» »Minkätähden lainaisin teille rahaa pelataksenne minun kanssani? Ette  saa minulta hituistakaan. Sitä paitsi ei minua haluta enää pelata.  Lopettakaamme mieluummin.» »Minä melkein haluan lopettaa toden teolla, lopettaa pelaamisen  teidänkin kanssanne.» Blixiltä pääsi pieni ilonhuudahdus. »Haluatteko todellakin, Condy? Luuletteko voivanne jättää? Voitteko  kokonaan luopua korteista? Niin ettette koskaan enää pelaa rahoista?  Ooh, kuinka se minua ilahduttaisi! Mutta antakaa olla sillään,  ellette ole aivan varma asiastanne. Mielestäni olisi parempi, että te  pelaisitte joka ilta klubissa kuin, että te rikkoisitte lupauksenne.» Condy oli vaiti, istui miettiväisenä ja puri etusormenniveltä. »Punnitkaa asia kahteen kertaan, Condy», pyysi Blix hartaasti,  »muistakaa se aina.» »On toinen asia nyt. — Travis — kolme kuukautta sitten en olisi voinut  vastata mistään. Silloin oli minun vaikeampi olla sitä tekemättä,  mutta nyt, niin, nyt on kaikki tyyni muuttunut. Minä tiedän nyt, että  ilahduttaisin teitä, Blix!» »En tiedä mitään, joka minua enemmän ilahduttaisi, Condy.» Hän ojensi hänelle kätensä. »Se on siis päätetty», sanoi hän tyyneesti. »En koskaan enää pelaa  uhkapeliä, Blix.» Blix puristi hänen kättään; sitten hypähti hän ylös, keräsi  mielihyvästä huokaisten kortit ja heitti ne kamiiniin. »Ooh, kuinka olen iloinen siitä, että tämä on ohi», huudahti hän  loistavin silmin. »Minä olen koko ajan ollut tästä pitävinäni, mutta  se on ollut minusta niin vastenmielistä. Te ette voi arvata, kuinka  vastenmielistä se on minusta ollut! Mikä siinä miehiä viehättää niin,  että he voivat sen takia valvoa yökaudet, käy yli minun ymmärrykseni.  Onko se todellakin täyttä totta, Condy, että te ette enää milloinkaan  pelaa uhkapeliä? Niin, tällä kertaa tiedän, että se on teidän  puoleltanne täyttä totta. Minä olen niin onnellinen, että tuskin voin  olla laulamatta!» »Taivaan tähden, älkää sitä tehkö», huusi hän reippaasti. »Te olette  kaunis ja rakastettava tyttö, Blix, vaikkapa teitä ei voisikaan juuri  sanoa kaunottareksi, ja te —» »Ooh, elkää nyt hassutelko!» pilaili Blix. »Te lupaatte sen?» »Kunniasanallani.» »Kiitos, sitten olen levollinen», sanoi hän. Mutta vaikka Condy oli täällä karkoittaakseen ajatuksiaan kirjasta,  ei hän voinut olla ajattelematta sitä, se seurasi häntä, kirjoittipa  hän sitten tahi ei. Eikäpä hän muuten olisi ollutkaan se synnynnäinen  kirjailija, joka hän kuitenkin oli. Ennen viimeistä pistettä ei hänellä  voinut olla lepoa eikä hetkenkään rauhaa. Hän ei voinut muuta ajatella  eikä muusta puhua kuin siitä. Kaikki hänen ajatuksensa, huomionsa ja  mielikuvansa kerääntyivät taukoamatta tämän yhden pisteen ympärille. Kun he nyt istuivat ulkonemassa ja näkivät kuun nousevan,  työskentelivät hänen aivonsa yhä sillä ainehistolla, joka niillä oli.  Äkkiä hän sanoi: »Minun täytyy todellakin pitää huolta siitä, että saan siinä kerrotuksi  jostakin salaisesta aarteesta. Mitä jännittävää on romaanissa, ellei  siinä ole joku salainen aarre? Ooh, Blix, jos vain saisin kirjoittaa  sitä herkeämättä. Se on tavattoman hyvä aihe. On melkein synti  antaa mitään siitä mennä pilalle. Se olisi viimeisteltävä hienoksi,  ymmärrättehän.» »Condy», sanoi Blix ja katsoi häntä tiukasti, »mikä teidät oikeastaan  sitoo The Timesiin? Ettekö voisi palata takaisin toimeenne, jos  ottaisitte lomaa niin pitkäksi aikaa, kun tarvitsette kirjaa varten?  Ettekö voisi saada sitä valmiiksi kuukaudessa, jos teillä ei olisi  muuta tehtävää? Otaksukaa, että te ottaisitte kuukauden loman — eikö  lehti voi pitää paikkaa teille niin kauan?» »Kyllä, luulenpa melkein, mutta pahinta on, että minä en ole  milloinkaan pannut säästöön centtiäkään palkastani. Kun minä lopetan,  niin loppuvat minun tuloni, ja millä ihmeellä minä sitten elän? Mitä te  haette? Tulitikkujako? Tässä on tulitikkuja.» Blix seisoi ja sormieli kaapin luona. Sitten hän kääntyi päin ja  työnsi laatikon kiinni nojautumalla sitä vastaan. Käsissään piti hän  hollantilaista porsliinista sokeriastiaa. Hän tuli pöydän luo ja  tyhjensi sen sisällön siniselle pöytäliinalle — 2—3 kultarahaa, noin 15  dollaria hopeassa ja kourallisen pientä rahaa. Vastaamatta Condyn moniin ihmetteleviin kysymyksiin, laski hän rahat ja  järjesti ne pieniksi tapuleiksi: kultaa, hopeaa, nikkeliä. »35 ja 7 siihen on 42», mumisi hän ja laski sormillaan. »Ja 6 on 48, ja  10 on 58, ja 10 on 68, ja sitten 10, 20, 30 ja 25 pikkurahoina.» Hän työnsi koko kasan Condylle. »Olkaa hyvä», sanoi hän, »tässä on se, jolla teidän on elettävä.» Condy tuijotti häneen. »Millä minun on elettävä», mumisi Condy. »Niin, sillä te kai voitte tulla toimeen kuukauden?» »Mistä te olette saanut kaikki nämä rahat? Kenen ne ovat?» »Ne ovat teidän omia rahojanne, Condy. Te olette itse lainannut ne  minulle, ja nythän ne tulevat hyvään tarpeeseen.» »Olenko minä lainannut teille rahaa?» »Kyllä, ne ovat ne rahat, jotka minä olen voittanut teiltä  pokerpelissä. Te ette luullut siitä kertyvän tällaista summaa?» »Huh! Ei juolahda mieleenikään kajota niihin», huudahti hän ja veti  kätensä pois kuin olisi sitä polttanut. »Kyllä, teidän pitää ottaa ne, Condy», sanoi hän varmasti. »Minä olen  säästänyt nämä rahat teille, joka pennin aina ensimmäisestä kerrasta  asti kun palasimme järven rannalle. Ja minun tarkoitukseni on koko ajan  ollut se, että te saatte ne takaisin sinä päivänä, jolloin päätätte  olla kokonaan pelaamatta.» »Mutta mitä järkeä siinä on!» vastusteli hän kädet syvällä taskuissa  ja tumman punaisena kasvoiltaan. »Se on — se on ihan mieletöntä, Blix!  Kuinka se saattoi mieleenne juolahtaa? Minä en tahdo kuulla sanaakaan  enää siitä asiasta. Minä en halua kajota senttiinkään näistä rahoista.  Mutta, Blix, te olette — te olette — paras nainen minkä tiedän. Te  olette nainen, joka sopii miehelle , se te olette.» Hän puri hampaansa  yhteen. »Teistä tulisi sille miehelle, jota te rakastaisitte, paras  sotatoveri, jonka hän voisi saada. Te veisitte häntä eteenpäin ja  pitäisitte hänet pystyssä, kunnes viimeinen panos olisi ammuttu. Minä  voisin tehdä mitä tahansa, jos teidänlaisenne nainen pitäisi minusta.  Ooh, Blix, minä — te ette aavista — —» hän yskäsi ja vaikeni äkkiä. »Teidän tulee ja pitää ottaa rahat», vastasi hän, »ne ovat teidän  rahojanne. Ellette te niitä ota, teette te minusta pelaajan, aivan  yksinkertaisesti, Condy. Ei olisi koskaan juolahtanut mieleenikään  pelata teidän kanssanne, jos minä olisin aikonut pitää penninkään  teidän rahoistanne. Alusta alkaen oli tarkoitukseni säilyttää rahat  teille, ja teidän piti saada ne takaisin heti kun te päätitte olla  pelaamatta. Ja juuri nyt on teillä rahan tarve. Te voitte ottaa lomaa  sanomalehdestä. Te ette mitenkään voi saada romaanista kunnollista,  kun teidän samalla täytyy huolehtia palstan täytteestä. Ettekö te  tiedä, kuinka kernaasti minä soisin että 'Viranomaisista huolimatta'  onnistuisi. Minä uskon teihin, Condy. Olen varma siitä, että te saatte  aikaan jotakin oikein arvokasta, kun vain saatte työrauhaa.» »Mutta te ja minä olemme pelanneet kuin mies miestä vastaan», huusi  Condy. »Miltä näyttäisi, jos esim. Sargeant tulisi ja haluaisi antaa  minulle takaisin ne rahat, jotka hän on minulta voittanut. Enkö olisi  vaivainen, jos ottaisin ne vastaan?» »Niin, mutta asia onkin juuri niin — että me emme ole pelanneet kuin  mies miestä vastaan. Silloinhan minä en olisi ollut peluria parempi.  Minä antauduin siihen sentähden että arvelin, että se kenties olisi  sopiva keino saada teidät luopumaan tuosta tavasta. Muutenhan olisi  ollut suorastaan hävytöntä pelata teidän kanssanne, kun tiesin kuinka  pelinhimoinen te olitte ja kuinka vaarallista se oli teille. Ettekö voi  sitä ymmärtää? Ja nyt on tulos se, että te olette tauonnut pelaamasta  ja että teillä on rahoja riittävästi, niin että voitte ottaa lomaa ja  kirjoittaa romaaninne valmiiksi. Riemukustannusliike on nimenomaan  kehoittanut teitä kirjoittamaan jännittävän romaanin; te olette  keksinyt oivallisen aiheen; te olette oikea mies sitä käsittelemään,  ja nyt teillä on varoja, että voitte heittäytyä vapaaksi ja tehdä sen.  — Condy!» — huudahti hän äkkiä, »ettekö voi nähdä mikä etu teillä  on? Eikö teissä ole niin paljon suurta miestä, että te voitte nähdä  edun, kun se on aivan edessänne? Luuletteko te sitä paitsi, että minä  haluaisin ottaa rahoja teiltä? Ettekö te sitten voi käsittää, että te  loukkaatte minua, kun kieltäydytte vastaanottamasta näitä rahoja, jotka  ovat teidän? Siltä minusta tuntuu. Se teidän täytyy ymmärtää. Jos te  välitätte rahtusen verran minusta, niin ottakaa rahat!» — — *       *       *       *       * Condyn toimittaja pisti kynän korvan taa ja katseli häntä silmälasien  yli. »No hyvä, Rivers», sanoi hän, »niin se nyt on. Te teette luonnollisesti  omassa asiassanne mielenne mukaan. Jos jäätte meille, on kaikki  hyvin. Mutta minä voin yhtä hyvin sanoa teille suoraan, että minä en  luule voivani ottaa tänne toista miestä kuukauden ajaksi tekemään  teidän työtänne ja sitten ajaa häntä ovelle. Minä en mielelläni teitä  menetä, mutta jos teillä lomanne aikana on tilaisuus päästä toiseen  sanomalehteen, en minä puolestani halua sitä estää.» »Te tarkoitatte siis, että minulla on hyvin vähän mahdollisuutta alkaa  täällä uudestaan, jos otan lomaa?» »Kyllä, sitä tarkoitan.» Tuli äänettömyys. Condy viipyi; sitten hän nousi. »Otan sen vastuulleni», selitti hän. Samana iltana kertoi hän Blixille kuinka oli käynyt. »Nyt on taistelu edessä, Blix.» XII. Mutta pitikö Blix hänestä? Kaksikymmentä kertaa päivässä teki Condy tämän kysymyksen itselleen;  kun hän istui piiloisessa paikassaan klubissa, japanilaisen suojustimen  takana; kun hän meni kaupungin läpi työhönsä; kun hän istui hänen  luonaan Bessemerin pienessä ruokasalissa ja näki kaupungin lepäävän  tuolla alhaalla usvaisessa puolihämyssä tai säteilevässä iltaruskon  valossa. Kaksikymmentä kertaa päivässä tuli hän ratkaisevaan,  kielteiseen tulokseen ja alkoi taas kysellä uudestaan. Yli sen  tosiasian, että Blix oli huvitellut hänen seurassaan näinä viimeisinä  kuukausina, ei Condy voinut löytää merkkiäkään kehotukseen. Muuten  osoittivat jäljet pikemminkin päinvastaiseen suuntaan. Hän ei epäröinyt  hituistakaan jättää häntä ja lähteä New Yorkiin, ehkäpä ainaiseksi.  Vajaan kuukauden jälkeen olisi heidän toverillinen seurustelunsa  lopussa, eikä hän tietenkään näkisi häntä koskaan enään. Hän ei uskaltanut antaa hänen tietää miten hänen laitansa oli, että hän  vihdoinkin oli alkanut rakastaa häntä toden teolla, ettei siinä nyt  enää ollut mitään teennäistä. Selitys tekisi lopun heidän »parhaimmasta  ajastaan», ennenkun hän vielä matkustaisikaan. Mutta joka päivä ja  tunti, kun he olivat yhdessä, oli hänen yhä vaikeampi hillitä itseään. Nämä sisäiset taistelut ja se juurtunut kestävyys, jolla hän antautui  työhönsä, painoivat Condyn olentoon uuden leiman. Blix oli opettanut  hänen olemaan luja, ja nyt kehittyi hän nopeasti vissiin vakavuuteen ja  päättäväisyyteen, vissiin voimaan , jota hän ei ennen ollut tuntenut. Antaisiko hän Blixin lähteä pois, unohtaa hänet ehkäpä ainiaaksi,  tietämättä mitä hän merkitsi hänelle? Päättäisikö hän puhua, ennenkun  Blix matkusti? Condy ei ollut siitä selvillä? Ne olivat kysymyksiä,  jotka asianhaarat saivat ratkaista. Hän ei sanoisi mitään, ellei hän  saisi varmuutta siitä, että Blix piti hänestä; ja jos hän piti, antaisi  hän kyllä itse hänelle vihjauksen, viittauksen, että nyt pitäisi hänen  puhua. Mutta päivät vierivät; Blixin lähtöaika tempautui yhä lähemmäksi  ja lähemmäksi; eikä hän antanut hänelle pienintäkään merkkiä. Hänen rakkautensa Blixiin ja kirja — näihin kahteen asiaan  keskittyi nyt koko hänen elämänsä. Vähitellen sai »Viranomaisista  huolimatta» kiinteämmän muodon. Kullankaivajain ravintola ja  Maanpakolaisten klubi oli jo valmis, Billy Isham alkoi jo työntyä  etualalle, kaappausretkikunta ja señora Estrada (kahtia revittyine  käyntikortteineen) olivat esitetyt, ja retkikunta oli valmis  puikahtamaan merelle. Mutta siinä tuli eteen uusi pulma. »Todellisuudessahan ei minulla ole vähintäkään käsitystä meriasioista»,  tunnusti Condy eräänä päivänä, kun hän puhui Blixin kanssa. Kun Billy  Ishamin on komennettava kaapparikuunaria, on minun pakko tietää mikä  kuunari on. Ainakin pitää minun olla tietävinäni se. Enkä minä tunne  merimieskieltä, ainakaan en sitä todellista. Minä en ikinä usko, että  oikean merimiehen päähän pälkähtäisi sanoa: 'Vielä kerran' tai 'Anna  pudota siihen.' Meidän on mentävä tervehtimään kapteenia ja keräämään  useampia teknillisiä termejä.» Tämä manööveri onnistui mainiosti. Kapteeni Jack oli tulta ja liekkiä  heti kun Condy ja Blix kertoivat hänelle mistä oli kysymys. »Vai niin, panetteko te Billy Ishamin kirjaan? Sepä oli, piru vie,  ajatus, joka voi heittää kaiken muun varjoon! Minä olen aina sanonut,  että Billy tarvitsi vain miehen pilettiluukulle ja näyttäjän, ja hän on  varmasti yhtä hyvä kuin kokonainen eläinnäyttely.» »Me aiomme lähettää sen New Yorkiin ja saada sen painetuksi, heti kun  se on valmis», sanoi Blix. »Hyvä, siitä tulee ensiluokkaista luettavaa, neiti; se on nimi, johon  kyllä kiinnitetään huomiota: ’Viranomaisista huolimatta’.» Joka keskiviikko ja sunnuntai-iltapäivänä tulivat Blix ja Condy  pelastusasemalle. Kapteeni otti heidät vastaan puettuna virkatakkiin ja  siniseen kudottuun nuttuun ja vei heidät sisälle sievään kotiinsa. »No kuinka käy kertomuksen?» tapasi hän kysyä. Sitten luki Condy uusimman luvun hänelle kapteenin kävellessä  edestakaisin lattialla tuimasti rypistynein kulmakarvoin ja sikaari  suussa tarkaten joka sanaa. Condy kertoi historian ensimmäisessä  persoonassa ja antoi Billy Ishamin toverin kuvailla niitä kohtauksia  ja tapauksia, joissa hän itse oli ollut mukana. Condy kutsui tätä  sankariaan nimellä »Barke Cassowan», nimi, josta hän oli jotensakin  ylpeä. Mutta siihen ei kapteeni laisinkaan tahtonut suostua. Sankari  Cassowan oli hänelle aivan yksinkertaisesti »kafftin». »Nooh», saattoi Condy sanoa muistikirja kädessään, »nyt olemme tulleet  Mazatlaniin, kapteeni. Sitten meidän pitäisi saada seuraavaan lukuun  vähän järjestystä.» »Niin, kyllä, minä tulen mukaan», tapasi kapteeni silloin sanoa, heti  asiaa harrastaen. »Odottakaa vain kunnes saan jalkineet riisutuksi.  Minä ajattelen helpommin, kun olen kengittä», ja kun hän sitten oli  työntänyt kengät jaloistaan, tapasi hän mielellään kulkea edes takaisin  sukkasilla samalla kun hän yhä rajummin tuprutteli sikaaria, ja kun hän  lämpeni kertomuksesta, puhalsi hän savun ulos molemmista korvistaan ja  huitoi hurjasti ilmaa hehkuvin kasvoin ja säkenöivin silmin. »No, katsotaanpa nyt. Ensimmäinen minkä 'kafftin' tekee tultuaan Mazatlaniin, on tietysti se, että hän ilmoittaa tulonsa señora Estradalle — sähköteitse, ymmärrettävästi; ja kuulkaa, se on tapahtuva merkkikielellä.» »Mitä?» »Te voitte laskea kolme kirjainta oikeasta. Jos teidän esim. on  kirjoitettava parkki, niin aloitatte te s:llä, joka on kolmas kirjain  p:n jälkeen. Sitten tulee a:n tilalle d, ja r-kirjaimen sijaan u, k on  n ja i on l. Te kirjoitatte siis parkki: sdunal; ja kun señora Estrada  saa sähkösanoman, tietää hän, että hänen on luettava kolme kirjainta taapäin koko ajan. Salakirjoitus yzzol esim. merkitsee tuuli. Lukekaa  vain kolme kirjainta taapäin u, z, z, o, l:stä, niin saatte tuuli. Te  voitte laittaa kokonaisen ketjun tuollaisista sähkösanomista, vain sitä  varten että ne näyttäisivät luonnollisilta. Mitä arvelette?» »Se on suurenmoista», mumisi Condy ja teki muistiinpanoja. »Sitten pitää kafftinilla ja Billy Ishamilla olla miehistöä. Ja  kafftin ostaa kuusipykälikön Mazatlanista — sen kuusipykälikön,  tiedättehän, joka joutui epäkuntoon ja pilasi kaiken. Tai, ei, älkää  ottako kuusipykälikköä, ottakaa mieluummin neljäkkö — vanhanaikainen  mustapuinen neljäkkö. Antakaa Billyn ostaa se, sentähden että se on  niin halpa.» »Kuinka se joutui epäkuntoon, kapteeni?» kysyi Blix. »Eikö olisi hyvä saada siihen teknillinen erityisseikka, Condy?» »Kyllä, katsokaa, kafftinin ja Billyn onnistuu saada sellainen  kuunari, jossa on tilaa niin vähän, että heidän täytyy valmistaa  ruoka kajuutassa. Kvadrantti on hyllyllä kamiinin yläpuolella ja  paisuu lämmössä, niin että kun kafftin ottaa merkin, joutuu hän 50  neljännespenikulmaa pois reitiltä ja syöksee maihin siellä, missä  hallituksen joukot odottavat häntä.» »Sitten on vielä toinen kohta, kapteeni», sanoi Condy. »Me haluaisimme  kernaasti sovittaa tähän myöskin jonkun salatun aarteen. Ettekö voi  keksiä jotakin uutta siihen suuntaan, jotakin, joka ei ole aivan  nukkavierua? Minä en voi enää käyttää tuota vanhaa juttua maahan  kaivetusta rahalippaasta. Pitäkää huoli siitä, että hän pääsee jonkin  jäljille, joka on omaisuuden veroinen — jotakin uutta.» »Kyllä, tosiaan. Hyvä ajatus», vastasi kapteeni ja astui permannon  poikki jättäen sukistaan suuria jälkiä, »malttakaahan kun hiukan  ajattelen.» Hän repi tukkaansa ja alkoi: »Meidän on saatava jotakin  uutta ja merkillistä, jotakin, jota ei ennen ole kuvattu. Niin, no nyt  saatte kuulla! Nyt olen siitä selvillä! Antakaa kafftinin saada vihiä  pienestä virtakuunarista, joka on uponnut kaksitoistasataa vuotta  ennen hänen aikaansa jossakin Etelä-Ameriikan suuressa virrassa tulvan  aikana — jotakin sinne päin olen itse kuullut kerrottavan. Kuunari meni  pohjaan ja hautautui hiekkaan ja liejuun, noin 20 jalan syvyyteen, ja  sitten on virta — tiedättehän kyllä kuinka noiden suurten virtojen  laita on — muuttanut väylää sillä kohdalla, ja kuunari makaa maalla,  t.s. 20 jalkaa maan alla, mutta rakennusaineiltaan yhtä terveenä kuin  sinä päivänä, jolloin se laskettiin vesille.» »Hyvä!» »Hyvä! Laittakaa niin että se upposi lastineen, joka käsitti 500  laatikkoa whiskyâ, prima tavaraa, 7,000 litranpulloa korkittua  ja lakattua, aivan ilmanpitävästi. No eihän kafftin ole eilen  syntynyt, eikä myöskään Billy Isham. Ah ei, niillä on sentään vähin  järjentapaistakin! He osaavat laskea. Tuo whisky on maannut ja  kerrostunut kaikessa rauhassa kaksitoista sataa vuotta. Minkä arvoisia  luulette te 7,000 sellaista ja sen ikäistä pulloa olevan? Kaksikymmentä  dollaria pullo on kai kohtuullinen hinta, olkaa hyvä! Siinä on aarre!  Kafftin ja Billy Ishamin on vain kaivettava hiekkaa kahdenkymmenen  jalan syvyyteen ja tuotava ylös 100,000 dollaria — jos he voivat löytää  kuunarin . Blix löi ilosta huudahtaen kätensä yhteen; Condy läimäytti polveensa ja  huusi: »Se on, surma soikoon, yhtä hyvä kuin London Doddin opiumilaiva! Te  olette kautta sieluni oikea aarre, kapteeni, kertomuksia kokoavalle  miehelle.» K.D.B. ei myöskään ollut itsenäisiä harrastuksia vailla. Hän ympäröi  itsensä kuin jonkunlaisella arvokkaisuuden varustuksella, eikä  milloinkaan ottanut mitään muuten kuin pitämällä kolme sormea suunsa  edessä. Hän oli jonkun aikaa »lukenut puvussa», kertoi hän. »Lukenut puvussa?» »Niin. Lukenut mainioiden kirjailijain teoksia puettuina niinkuin  niissä kuvatut henkilöt. Siitä maksettiin hyvin, ja minulla oli hyvin  hieno yleisö. Minä tapasin esittää Browningin ’Seinäsolassa' ja  ’Laskan’ samana iltana, ja onnistuin aina. Ensin esitin ’Seinäsolassa’  Ludvig viidennentoista aikuisessa hameessa siihen kuuluvine  valehiuksineen, ja alta päin olin puettu kuin nais-cowboy. Kun  ’Seinäsolassa’ oli loppunut, menin minä sivuhuoneeseen, riisuin hameen  ja peruukin ja esiinnyin sitten Laskana ukkonen taustanani. Se oli  minun näytelmistöni voimakkaimpia mahtivaikutuksia, ja yleisö tapasi  aina huutaa minut esille näytöksen jälkeen.» Silloin nyökäytti kapteeni hämmästyneenä päätään ja mumisi: »Se oli suurenmoista; se oli suurenmoista!» Blix ja Condy huomasivat pian että K.D.B. heidän vierailukäynneillään  aina sai tilaisuutta huvittaa heitä puhumalla leveästi ja laajasti  pitkissä keskusteluissa erilaisista aineista. Ensimmäisellä  kerralla heittäytyi hän puhumaan alpeista, seuraavana sunnuntaina  bakteorologiasta; seuraavana keskiviikkona kristalleista, ja kun he  seuraavan kerran tulivat asemalle, täytyi Condyn ja Blixin sulattaa  tavattoman pitkä esitelmä Tanskan kuningaskunnan synnystä, sen  historiasta ja kehityksestä läpi aikojen. Condy oli kuin pilvistä  pudonnut. »En ole ikinä moista nähnyt», sanoi hän, »tätäpä vasta voipi sanoa  kasvatukseksi. Luulenpa, suoraan sanoen, että hän tietää kaikki!» »Viranomaisista huolimatta» edistyi hyvin, mutta kun Condy kerran  oli uskaltanut ryhtyä käsittelemään teknillistä merenkulkua koskevia  asioita, täytyi hänen alituisesti turvautua kapteeniin, jotta hän  ei ajaisi karille. Hän oli jossakin merikertomuksessa tavannut  sanan »ulkolaitalankku» ja yhteydestä, missä sitä oli käytetty, oli  hän tullut siihen käsitykseen, että se oli joku laivan rakennuksen  teknillinen osa. Ja niin oli hän eräänä heikkona hetkenä kirjoittanut,  että hänen kuunarinsa nimi oli maalattu komeilla kultaisilla  kirjaimilla sen ulkolaitalankkuihin. »Mitä ulkolaitalankut ovat, Condy?» oli Blix kysynyt, kun hän luki  luvun hänelle. »Ne ovat ne, joihin laivan nimi maalataan», selitti Condy räpäyttämättä  silmää. »Minä en sitä niin tarkkaan tiedä, vaan minusta se sointuu  hyvin.» Seuraavana päivänä luki hän saman luvun kapteenille, kun tämä äkkiä  keskeytti hänet huudahtaen kuin vaikean ruumiillisen tuskan valtaamana. »Mitä se on? Lukekaa se vielä kerran!» pyysi hän. »Kun he olivat vain pari veneen pituutta siitä», luki Condy,  »saattoivat he eroittaa kuunarin nimen, joka oli maalattu komeilla  kultaisilla kirjaimilla ulkolaitalankkuihin.» »Taivas!» ähki kapteeni ja löi otsaansa. Sitten hän huusi: »Tuo  ulkolaitalankku! Tuo ulkolaitalankku! Ettekö te tiedä, että  ulkolaitalankku on se, joka on lähinnä ylhäällä laivan anturassa? Te  tarkoitatte peräpeililankkua, ettekä ulkolaitalankkua. Sepä oli, surma  soikoon, vaikea takaheitto!» He jäivät sinne ja söivät tällä kertaa yhdessä perheen kanssa, jonka  jälkeen K.D.B. puolen tunnin ajan huvitti heitä Elefantinen luona  tehdyillä tieteellisillä kaivaustöillä. Olisi voinut luulla, että hän  itse oli ollut siellä. Mutta kun hän siirtyi linnoitustieteeseen, ei  Blix enää kauemmin voinut hillitä itseään: »On todellakin ihailtavaa kaikki tuo, mitä te tiedätte ja olette  lukenut. Kuinka on teillä ollut aikaa opiskella kaikkea?» »Täytyyhän sitä olla jonkinlaista sivistystä», vastasi K.D.B. pukevan  kainosti. Sillä välin oli Condy huomannut puoleksi täytetyn kirjahyllyn  vastapäätä olevalla seinällä, ja hänelle juolahti äkkiä aatos mieleen.  Hän kirjoitti muistikirjansa lehteen: »Koeta hänen tietojaan G:ssä ja  H:ssa» ja hän piti sitä niin, että vain Blix saattoi sen nähdä. Mutta  Blix ei ymmärtänyt hituistakaan, ja Condy käytti sen vuoksi ensimmäistä  tarjoutuvaa tilaisuutta ja kääntyi ent. pukutaiteilijattaren puoleen  tehden seuraavan viattoman huomautuksen: »Kuulkaahan, koska linnoituksista on puhe, rouva Hoskins, eikö Gibraltar todellakin ole suuremmoinen kallio?» »Onko se kallio?» huudahti tämä hämmästyneenä. »Minä olen aina luullut,  että se on saari.» »Ei, se on kallio, ja siinä on linnoitus, tiedättehän, linna  jotakuinkin samanlainen kuin Heidelbergin vanha linna. Oletteko  milloinkaan kuullut tai lukenut jotakin Heidelbergin yliopistosta?» Mutta nyt ei K.D.B. tiennyt kerrassaan mitään. Hän oli aivan  tietämätön Gibraltarin ja Heidelbergin suhteen, samoin ei hän tiennyt  inokulatsionista, Japanista ja Kosciuskosta mitään. H:hon asti oli hän  aivan varma, mutta tämän kirjaimen toisella puolella oli ihan pelkkää  pimeyttä. »Mutta miten tämä on ymmärrettävä, Condy?» kysyi Blix, kun he jäivät  yksin. »Minulla on omat ajatukseni asiasta», vastasi hän, tukehtumaisillaan  naurusta, »odottakaa vain sunnuntaihin, niin saamme nähdä. Minä kyllä  tiedoitan sen teille. Minä uskallan panna dollarin senttiä vastaan,  että sunnuntaina on K.D.B:llä tarjottavana meille jotakin, joka alkaa  'i':llä.» Ja niin kävikin. Hän puhui »välillisestä veroituksesta». »Katsokaa, tiesinhän minä sen!» riemuitsi Condy, kun hän ja Blix olivat  kotimatkalla. »Hän on ehtinyt läpi As-Bal, Bal-Cis j.n.e., hän on jo  ahertanut läpi Cis-Dan ja Dan-Eva. Nyt hän paraillaan opiskelee Hav-Kin  ja sillä tavalla on hänellä koko vyyhti valmiina X, Y, Å, ÄA ja Ö-kin.» »Tietosanakirjastako?» »Niin, varmasti. Eipä ollut ihme, että hän ei tiennyt mitään, kun tuli  kysymykseen Gibraltar. Hän ei silloin vielä ollut ehtinyt G:hen.» »Hän lukee siis tietosanakirjaa?» »Kyllä, ja hän saa sen vihottain. Ettekö sitä huomaa? Hän lukee  sieltä laveammat kirjoitukset ja laskettelee ne meille muistista.  Tietää jotakin ja sitten voida siitä puhua, on hänen mielestään  kultuuria. 'Jonkinlaista sivistystähän pitää olla’. Muistatteko, kun  hän sanoi sen. Meidän avioliittokokelaamme näkyvät olevan todellisia  kultakaivoksia.» Se oli ihana, unohtumaton kuukausi heille molemmille. Keskellä elämän  kuohuntaa olivat he yhtä yksin kuin autiolla saarella. Blix oli  perinpohjaisen harkinnan jälkeen eronnut seuraelämästä, joka oli käynyt  hänelle vastenmieliseksi. Condy oli vähitellen liukunut sekä mies- että  naistuttaviensa piiristä; ja nyt seurasivat he toisiaan, nuo kaksi,  elivät pienessä maailmassa, jonka he itse olivat itselleen rakentaneet;  onnellisina toistensa seurassa nauttivat he nykyisyydestä eivätkä muuta  toivoneet kuin saada muilta rauhassa hoitaa omia asioitaan. He tapasivat joka päivä toisensa. Kello yhdeksästä kolmeen kirjoitteli  Condy kirjaansa, mutta joka ilta tapasi Blix hänet tutussa  pienessä ruokasalissa. Torstai- ja sunnuntai-iltapäivisin menivät,  he pelastusasemalle, ja muina päivinä retkeilivät he kaupungin  etäisimmissä osissa. Noin kolme viikkoa ennen uutta vuotta istui Condy eräänä päivänä kahden  ajoissa paitahihasillaan klubissa tavallisessa nurkassaan varjostimen  takana, ja kirjoitti minkä kerkesi puoleksi pureskeltu sikaarinpätkä  hampaiden välissä. Hänen kyynäspäänsä kohdalla lepäsi käsikirjoitus,  aivan suorakulmaisena järkäleenä. Viime viikon aikana oli työ sujunut  niin helposti, että hän sekä sitä ihmetteli että siitä iloitsi. Viimein kastoi hän kynän, levitti kyynäspäät sivulle, tempasi pöydän  lähemmä ja kirjoitti ripeällä loppuheilahduksella viimeisen rivin  kirjaan, heitti sitten äkkiä kynän pois ja kuivasi sen imupaperilla,  niinkuin olisi se ollut valmiin teoksen viimeinen ratkaiseva vahvistus. »Noo», mumisi hän yhteen puristetuin huulin, »nyt olen saanut sinut valmiiksi.» Samana päivänä luki hän loppuluvun Blixille, ja tämä auttoi häntä  koteloimaan käsikirjoituksen pikalähetystä varten. Hän vaati lujasti,  että se oli lähetettävä samana päivänä ja kirjoitti itse osoitteen  kuoreen. Sitten menivät he yhdessä pakettipostikonttoriin ja »Viranomaisista  huolimatta» lähetettiin matkalle yli mannermaan. XIII. Vieri viikko; vieri vielä toinenkin. Vuoden loppu läheni. Kymmenen  päivän kuluttua olisi Blix poissa. Täti Kihmiltä oli tullut kirje  ja kirjeen kera lahjana hänen veljentyttärelleen hienon hieno  mustanahkainen matkaopas täynnä hiottuja pulloja, ebenholtsiharjoja ja  kilpikonnakampoja. Blixin piti matkustaa tammikuun toisena päivänä. Mutta hänen ei ollut helppo jättää kotia. Hän ei ollut koskaan varemmin  ollut poissa, hän ei ollut koskaan ollut poissa isänsä luota muuta  kuin korkeintaan viikon, eikä myöskään Howardin ja Dettenin luota.  Hänellä oli epämääräinen kauhun ja apean mielen tunne ajatellessaan  tuota Atlannin valtameren rannalla olevaa jättiläiskaupunkia ja sen  suurenmoista ja valtavaa elämää, jossa kansakunnan sydän sykähteli. Hän  ei tuntenut siellä ainoatakaan ihmistä paitsi täti Kihmin. Se olisi  uusi olemisto, johon hän menisi, elämä täynnä työtä ja opiskelua,  ankarampi vaatimuksissaan kuin mikään muu, jota hän varemmin oli  kokenut. Isänsä, ystävänsä, kotinsa — kaikki oli hänen jätettävä.  Eipä ollut ihme, että Blix tunsi joutuvansa hämilleen, kun hänen  odotettavissaan oli mullistus, jolla oli tällainen ulottuvaisuus. Mutta  vaikka kyyneleet silloin tällöin vierivätkin, ei niitä kukaan saanut  nähdä. Rohkeudella, joka oli hänelle ominaista, näki Blix vanhan vuoden  viimeisten päivien vierivän ohi ja uuden vuoden ja sen mukana uuden  elämän tulevan yhä lähemmäksi. Condyllä sitä vastoin oli suorastaan paha olla. Nämä kolme  eriskummallista kuukautta olivat nyt ohi. Blixin piti lähteä. Vajaan  viikon kuluttua olisi hän poissa. Hän olisi nähnyt hänet viimeisen  kerran. Entä sitten? Hän kuvitteli kuinka hän — kun hän olisi sanonut  Blixille hyvästi ja juna katoaisi kauaksi savupilveen, kääntyisi  takaisin ja kulkisi kohti sitä elämää, joka taas alkaisi hänelle, ja  tarttuisi taas totuttuun työhönsä. Silloin ei olisi paljon odotettavaa;  hän ei näkisi Blixiä iltapäivisin eikä istuisi hänen luonaan iltasin  Bessemerien pienessä salissa katsellen yli kaupungin ja lahdelman;  hän ei aamuisin heräisi varmana siitä, että ennenkun aurinko on  laskenut, olisi hän taas nähnyt hänet, ollut hänen kanssaan, kuullut  hänen äänensä soinnun. Koituvat kuukaudet tulisivat pitkäksi tuskaksi,  pitkäksi, ankaraksi ja ilottomaksi elämäksi ja raatamiseksi ilman  häntä. Millä tavalla viettäisi hän ensimmäisen illan, kun hän oli  yksin? Eikä Blix hänestä pitänyt. Vihdoinkin oli hän siitä varma. Eikä  hänelle suotu sitäkään laihaa lohdutusta, että olisi tiennyt hänenkin  olevan onnettoman. Blix ei ollut häntä koskaan rakastanut eikä myöskään  tulisi sitä koskaan tekemään. Hän piti häntä vain hyvänä ystävänä ja  toverina, siinä kaikki. Condyllä oli liian selvä äly antaakseen itseään  narrata siinä kohdassa. Nyt oli aika hänen lähteä, eikä hän ollut  antanut hänen huomata mitään, eikä ollut antanut hänelle pienintäkään  viittausta. Viimeiset päivät vierivät. Blix oli pakannut matkalaatikkonsa,  varannut makuupaikan, ostanut piletin. He kävivät hyvästelemässä  vanhoja paikkoja, jotka olivat tulleet heille niin tutuiksi —  kiinalaiskaupunkia, kultaista seinäsolaa, satamaa, San Andreas järveä,  Sähkölennätinmäkeä, Lunaa — olivat sanoneet hyvästi Richardille ja  vanhalle Richardsonille. Viimeiseksi olivat he säästäneet K.D.B:n ja  kapteenin. Blixin piti lähteä tammikuun 2 p:nä. Uudenvuoden päivänä  piti hänen ja Condyn vielä kerran käydä pelastusasemalla ja sieltä  pitkin rannikkoa mustikanvarsia kasvavan pienen kehäkaltaan ympäri  — jossa he olivat keskenään sopineet, että he aina kirjoittaisivat  toisilleen ensimmäisen siellä käyntinsä vuosipäivänä — ja sitten vielä  viimeisen kerran nousta vuorille ja oikaista yli lentohiekkakenttien  takaisin kaupunkiin. Tuli sitten vanhan vuoden viimeinen päivä, viimeisen edellinen, jona  he saivat olla yhdessä. He käyttivät sen pitkään retkeilyyn meren  puolella, seurasivat linnoitusta aina Meiggin veistämölle. He tulivat  illalliseksi kotiin, ja kun he olivat syöneet ja toiset olivat menneet,  istuutuivat he ulkonemaan odottamaan uutta vuotta. Heidän istuessaan ja katsellessaan ulos, sytytti iltataivas ikkunan  toisensa jälkeen hehkumaan, kunnes koko tämä puoli kaupunkia ikäänkuin  katseli heitä tuhansin punaisin silmin. Lukemattomia ikkunoita,  loppumaton verkko katuja ja puistoteitä, mutta kaikki autioita.  Tähän aikaan olivat kadut tyhjät, ja niin ne olisivat aamun koittoon  asti. Siellä ei näkynyt ainoatakaan ihmistä; ihmiskasvoja ei näkynyt  ainoassakaan noista tuhansista hehkuvista ikkunoista; ei ainoakaan  askel keskeyttänyt asfalttikatujen hiljaisuutta. Ilta, vanhan vuoden viimeinen, oli kaunis. Heille näkymättömän kuun  valkoinen, kuulas valo leveni laajalti ja kirkkaasti yli kaupungin sitä  myöten kuin auringonvalo vaaleni. Oli niin lämmin, että saattoi pitää  ikkunan auki, ja yli kolme tuntia istuivat Condy ja Blix ja katselivat  alas yli kaupungin vuoden kiiriessä. Silloin tällöin tunsivat he  poskiaan sivelevän keveän vihurin, joka toi puutarhoista puiden ja  kukkien tuoksua ja viehättävän heikon, pienen tuulahduksen valtamereltä  tuolta kaukaa niemekkeiden takaa. Näkyi tähden lento. He näkivät sen molemmat paikaltaan. Condy ei ollut liikahtanut  viimeisen neljännestunnin aikana. »Se oli suurenmoista», sanoi hän hiljaa. »Blix teidän pitää kirjoittaa  — meidän täytyy usein kirjoittaa toisillemme.» »Niin», vastasi tyttö, »me emme saa unhoittaa toisiamme; sillä meillä  on ollut liian hyvä yhdessä.» »Neljä vuotta on pitkä aika», jatkoi hän. »Neljässä vuodessa voi paljon  tapahtua. Haluaisinpa tietää, missä olen neljän vuoden kuluttua. Meillä  on ollut hyvä, niinkauan kuin tätä on kestänyt, Blix.» »Niin, niin on.» Hän istui leuka käden varassa ja kuun valo loisti hänen pienissä,  ruskeissa silmissään. Siis, nyt hän menettäisi tytön. Hän oli nyt huomannut rakastavansa  häntä rajattomasti ja tunsi sentähden eronhetkellä sitä katkerampaa  tuskaa. Mitä hänestä tulisi, kun Blix oli poissa. Mihinkä hän  ryhtyisi täyttääkseen sen rajattoman tyhjyyden, jonka Blix jättäisi  jälkeensä? Eikö hän koskaan saisi tietää mitä hän hänelle oli? Miksi  ei sanoa, miksi ei tunnustaa, että hän rakasti häntä? Ei, Condy tiesi,  ettei Blix rakastanut häntä; hänen oli siis vaiettava. Hänen täytyi  pusertaa salaisuutensa itseään vasten niinkuin spartalainen poika  varastamansa ketun, puripa se häntä kuinka paljon tahansa. Hän ja  Blix olivat eläneet kokonaista kaksi kuukautta mitä ihmeellisimmässä,  puhtaimmassa onnessa olematta siitä juuri tietoisemmat kuin kaksi  suurta ja tervettä poikaa. Saattaa nyt tuota hankalaa ja häiritsevää  elementtiä, rakkautta — vastaamatonta rakkautta tietenkin — heidän  välilleen, olisi hulluutta. Blix antaisi hänen tietää, aivan  avonaisesti ja rehellisesti, ettei hän rakasta häntä, ja koko heidän  ihana toveruutensa päättyisi kohtaukseen. Ennen kaikkea toivoi Condy,  että hän Blixin lähdettyä voisi muistella näitä kuukausia ilman että  niihin sekaantui ainoatakaan soraääntä. Jos Blixin muisto oli ainoa  minkä hän hänestä sai pitää, niin tahtoi hän myös saada tämän muiston  samentumattomana. Rakkaus häneen oli tehnyt hänestä miehen — sitä hän ei unhoittanut;  juuri siitä juontui hänessä se voima, joka teki hänelle mahdolliseksi  säilyttää tämän päättäväisen karskin äänettömyyden. Hän oli tullut  viisi vuotta vanhemmaksi näinä kahtena kuukautena; hän oli mies.  Vieläpä hänen suunsakin sulkeutui toisella tavalla. Juopa silmäkulmien  välillä oli syventynyt; ja hänen äänensä sointu oli tullut tummemmaksi.  Ei, ei; elipä hän kuinka kauan tahansa, milloinkaan hän ei voisi  unohtaa tätä yhdeksäntoistavuotista lasta, joka oli tullut niin  hiljaa, niin odottamatta hänen elämäänsä ja vaikuttanut sellaisella  vastustamattomalla voimalla siihen, niin kiistämättömästi parempaan  päin, kadotakseen sitten taas hänen luotaan vierivän vuoden mukana. Condy oli istunut hetkisen mietteissään ja leikkinyt savukekotelonsa  kannella; sitten valitsi hän savukkeen, pisti laatikon taskuunsa ja  etsi tulitikkua. Mutta hänen pieni teräksinen kotelonsa oli tyhjä. Blix  nousi ja hapuili kamiinihyllyä, tuli sitten ja ojensi hänelle tulitikun  ja jäi seisomaan hänen luokseen sillä välin kun Condy repäsi tulen  siihen. Vielä senkin jälkeen, kun Condy oli savukkeensa sytyttänyt,  seisoi hän siinä ja katseli häntä kädet ristissä. Hänen hiustensa,  toisen poskensa, leukansa ja kauniin pyöreän kaulan ääriviivat  kuvastuivat avonaisesta ikkunasta tulevaa heikkoa valoa vasten. Sitten  sanoi hän tyyneesti: »No, Condy?» »No, Blix!» »Niin, no?» toisti hän. »Blix!» huudahti Condy. »Siinäkö kaikki? Annatteko todellakin minun lähteä teidän luotanne niin  pitkäksi aikaa, sanomatta minulle muuta? Te arvelette, että te olette  ollut niin varovainen, te arvelette pitäneenne salaisuutenne niin hyvin  kätkettynä! Ettekö usko minun tietävän sitä, Condy? Luuletteko, että  nainen on niin sokea. Ei, teidän ei tarvitse sanoa kerrassaan mitään;  minä tiedän sen ja olen tiennyt sen — viikkokausia!» »Te tiedätte — ja te tiedätte mitä te sitten tiedätte?» huusi Condy  aivan kuin hengästyneenä. »Että te olette kulkenut täällä ja tekeytynyt niinkuin ette minua  rakastaisi. Mutta minä tiedän, että te rakastatte minua — että te  olette koettanut salata sitä minulta, sentähden että pelkäsitte, että  se voisi häiritä meidän hyvää suhdettamme, me kun olimme päättäneet  olla vain tovereita ja luopua kaikista 'tyhmyyksistä'. Sillä —  tuttavuutemme ensiaikoina tiesin minä, että te ette minua rakastanut,  vaikka te sanoitte niin tekevänne; mutta nyt, sittenkun — niin, aina  tuosta iltapäivästä kiinalaisessa ravintolassa — muistatteko? — olen  minä tiennyt, että te rakastatte minua, vaikka ette ole rakastavinanne.  Tuosta teeskentelystä minä tahdoin päästä, sitä minä toivoin, kun te  sanoitte että te rakastitte minua, ettekä sitä tehnyt, ja sitä toivon  nytkin, kun te olette niinkuin ette minua rakastaisi, vaikka minä tiedän , että te rakastatte» — ja Blix heitti päätään taapäin, kun hän  sanoi tuon tiedän ja katsoi hymyillen Condyyn puoleksi suljettujen  silmäluomien alta. »Minä en voi sietää tuota teeskentelyä», lisäsi hän.  »Meidän kahden täytyy olla suoria toisillemme.» »Blix, rakastatko sinä sitten minua?» Condy oli noussut, hän hengitti kiivaasti, savukkeen oli hän  sinkahuttanut pois, hänen kätensä aukenivat ja sulkeutuivat  hermostuneesti. »Oi rakkahin pieni Blix, rakastatko sinä siis minua?» He seisoivat tuokion siellä puolipimeässä ja katselivat toisiaan;  heidän sydämensä sykkivät ankarasti ja he saattoivat tuskin hengittää  tällä kiivaan jännityksen hetkellä. Täällä, tässä huoneessa, korkealla  kaupungin yläpuolella, oli muuan aalto saavuttanut korkeuspisteensä,  kaksi ihmistä seisoi äkkiä elämänsä ratkaisevassa käänteessä. Se  silmänräpäys, joka oli ollut valmistuksen alaisena näinä kahtena viime  kuukautena, näinä kahtena viimeisenä vuotena, kahtena viimeisenä  vuosisatana, katso, se oli tullut! »Rakastatko sinä minua todellakin, Blix?» Äkkiä oli uusi vuosi. Jossakin läheisyydessä alkoi soivien  kirkonkellojen kuoro juhlallisen laulunsa. He kuulivat sen, he kaksi kuulivat sen, kun he seisoivat siellä  kasvot kasvoja vastaan ja katselivat toisiaan silmiin, tuo kysymys  vielä vastaamatta heidän välillään, tuo kysymys, joka oli putkahtanut  esille juuri vuoden vaihteessa. — Oli vielä vanha vuosi, kun Condy  kysymyksensä teki. Sillä aikaa, kun Blix viivytti vastausta, oli uusi  vuosi tullut. Ja hän oli vielä vaiti, samalla kun ilma värisi ja paisui  kaupungin tuhatkielisestä kohinasta. Mutta vain silmänräpäyksen.  Sitten meni hän aivan hänen eteensä ja pani molemmat kätensä hänen  hartioilleen. »Hyvää uutta vuotta, sinä rakastettuni!» sanoi hän. *       *       *       *       * Uudenvuoden päivänä, viimeisenä päivänä, jonka he saivat olla yhdessä,  tekivät Blix ja Condy »retkensä», niinkuin he sitä nimittivät,  pelastusasemalle, Kultaiselle portille, vanhan linnoituksen toisella  puolella olevalle merenrannalle, alastomille, ruohon vihreille ja  kukkien kaunistamille vuorille ja hiekkasärkille ja golf-radan  vihreälle, tasaiselle kentälle. Blixillä oli ollut kiire sälyttäessään  viimeisiä tavaroitaan, ja he eivät päässeet lähtemään ennenkun lähemmä  kaksi. »No sepä!» huudahti kapteeni Jack kuultuaan, että Blix tuli  jäähyväisille. »Sepä kävi äkkiä, neiti Bessemer; halloo, Kitty, tulehan  tänne, niin saat kuulla. Neiti Bessemer on jäähyväiskäynnillä; lähtee  huomenna New-Yorkiin.» »Me tulemme teitä todellakin kaipaamaan, neiti», sanoi K.D.B.,  joka tuli huoneeseen keitettyjen vihannesten väkevän, läpitunkevan  tuoksun ympäröimänä. »New York — se se vasta kaupunki on! Se oli  ensin Manhattan nimeltään, niinkuin tiedätte, ja on hollantilaisten  perustama.» K.D.B. oli nähtävästi ehtinyt N-kirjaimeen. Blix käytti hienointa sotajuontaan saadakseen keskustelun johdetuksi  entisen laivakapteenin ja entisen pukutaiteilijattaren ensimmäiseen  kohtaukseen, mutta siitä ei ollut apua. Heidän avioliittokokelaansa  olivat ehkä hiukan hämillään ajatellessaan nyt »yksityisiä»  ilmoituksiaan, eivätkä Blix ja Condy koskaan saisi kuulla heidän omaa  esitystään kohtauksesta Lunan meksikolaisessa ravintolassa. Kapteeni  Jack oli huomattavan halukas vaihettamaan keskusteluainetta. »No, miten on kirjan laita?» kysyi kapteeni äkkiä Condyltä. »Mitähän  nuo kustantajaherrat siellä idässä arvelevat kafftinista ja Billy  Ishamista ja tuosta whisky-kuunarista?» Condy oli juuri samana päivänä aamusella saanut käsikirjoituksensa  palautetuksi ja samalla kirjeen Riemukustannusliikkeeltä. »Niin», vastasi hän, »asia ei ole aivan sillä kannalla kuin te  luulette. Minä olen saanut kirjan takaisin.» »Sepä hittoa!» huudahti kapteeni. »No, se oli teille pettymys? Vai  kuinka?» »Ooh», ehätti Blix selittämään, »me emme suinkaan ole menettäneet  rohkeuttamme. Me lähetämme sen heti taas matkalle.» Sitten hyvästeli hän heitä. »Luulenpa melkein, että te ette enää tapaa minua täällä, kun tulette  takaisin, neiti», sanoi kapteeni veräjällä, käsivarsi K.D.B:nsä  vyötäyksellä. »Minä olen taas alkanut rakentaa suunnitelmia. Te  tiedätte ehkä», lisäsi hän tuttavallisesti kuiskaten, »että kaikki  Californian kaivokset lähettävät kultaharkkojaan ja karikkeitaan  Selbyn sulatuslaitoksiin kerran viikossa? Se on sitä, että ensin ne  lähettävät ne San Franciscoon, ja sitten ne lähetetään Selbyhyn joka  keskiviikko-ilta pienellä Monticelli-nimisellä höyrylaivalla. Nuo  harkot ovat puoleksi kultaa ja puoleksi hopeaa, yhteen sulatettuina;  ne ovat laatikossa ja se laatikko peränpitäjänhytin alla, etupuolella.  Kuinka suuren luulette noiden harkkojen arvon olevan rahassa?  Sanonpa sen teille: viimeisen edellisellä viikolla oli niiden arvo  780,000 dollaria. Hyvä, nyt on niin, että minulla on merikartta  Vallejoa ympäröivästä lahdesta. Itse satamansuu ei ole vaarallinen,  mutta siellä on muutamia liejumatalikkoja, jotka pistäytyvät  kolmeneljännespenikulmaa maasta. Siellä on vettä kylliksi sellaiselle  kuin Whitehall, vaan ei — hm, esimerkiksi vartiolaivalle. Pari reipasta  vekkulia ja sumuinen yö — no, minä nyt tietenkään en ole sellaisissa  hommissa mukana, mutta joka tapauksessa, siinä sopisi kepponen tehdä,  eikö totta?» »Teidän ei pidä uskoa sanaakaan siitä niitä hän puhuu, neiti», tokasi K.D.B., »hän vain kerskailee.» »Minä luulen, että teidän suunnitelmanne estää Cunard-laivaa on  kylläkin hyvä», sanoi Condy — »ja helppo suorittaa. Teidänhän ei  tarvitse muuta kuin asettua sen tielle ja vetää hätälippu tankoon. Niin  olisi se varmasti pakoitettu panemaan pakin.» »Niin, niin kyllä, olen itsekin ajatellut tuota, mutta kuulkaahan nyt;  mikäpä estäisi sitä seuraamasta kuunaria, kun tavarat on saatu laivaan,  vain seuraamasta vanavedessä ja katsomasta missä noustaan maihin.» »Mutta sellaisella laivallahan on valtion kanssa tehty sopimus, joka  velvoittaa sen kuljettamaan postia meren yli», väitti Condy. »Se sitoo  sen. Ja siitä syystä on teidän jätettävä posti laivaan. Sitä te ette  saa ottaa; niin kauan kun sillä on Valtioiden posti laivassa, on se  pakoitettu jatkamaan matkaansa.» Kapteeni löi kämmenellään veräjän pylvästä. »Saakeli soikoon! Se ei ole koskaan juolahtanut mieleeni!» XIV. Blix ja Condy jatkoivat kulkuaan; yhä edelleen kapeaa tietä pitkin  rantaniittyjä ja soita, jotka sijaitsivat pelastusaseman ja Kultaisen  portin välillä; yhä edelleen itse Kultaiselle portille ja vanhan  linnoituksen ahavoituneiden muurien ulkopuolelle aina valtameren  rannalle ja sen lujille, valkoisille hiekkariutoille ja korkeiksi  kasautuneille vierinkiviharjanteille, missä ärjyaalto pauhasi ja vaahto  lakkaamatta sähisi. Kaukana maailmasta, täällä Tyvenen meren rannalla, viettivät he  uuden vuoden ensimmäistä päivää. Ylen määrin onnelliset he olivat ja  toisilleen kaikki kaikessa. Condy ei uhrannut pienintäkään ajatusta  huomispäivälle, jolloin hänen oli otettava jäähyväiset Blixiltä. Se  oli kerta kaikkiaan jotakin, joka ei ollut ajateltavissa, se oli  ulkopuolella mahdollisuuksien rajan, että tämä matkustaisi pois, että  he kaksi eroaisivat. Ja sitäpaitsi: suru aikanaan! Vielä oli huomiseen  kaksikymmentäneljä tuntia. Nykyisyys oli kylliksi. Se hellittämättömyys, jolla he pitivät kiinni silmänräpäyksestä,  heidän haltioitumisensa siitä, että saivat elää vain nykyhetkessä, oli  aikaansaanut varsin omituisen suhteen heidän välillään. Heidän molemminpuolisessa rakkaudessaan ei ollut mitään  avioliittoajatusta; he iloitsivat niin paljon yhdessäolostaan,  etteivät he tulleet ajatelleeksikaan tulevaisuutta. He rakastivat  toisiaan, siinä kaikki. He eivät nähneet tulevaisuutta pitemmälle  kuin seuraavaan päivään, ja senkin vain varkain ja vain nähdäkseen  tämän päivän onnellisuuden kaksin kerroin loistavana tulevan eron  tummaa taustaa vasten. Blix matkustaisi; hän ja Condy eivät näkisi  toisiaan aivan pian. Ajatus avioliitosta — sen vastuunalaisuuksineen,  sen velvollisuuksineen, sen juhlallisuuksineen, sen tuntemattomine  huolineen ja monine vakavine puolineen, sen välttämättömine  pettymyksineen — oli heille pikemminkin hieman vastenmielinen. Tähän  asti oli heidän herttainen onnensa ollut ilman tahraa ja vikaa. He  olivat iloinneet rajattomasti pienistä asioista. Olisi yhtä hyvä  antaa seikkailun päättyä tähän kaikessa alkuperäisessä suloudessaan,  ainoankaan katkeran hetken sitä sumentamatta, ainoankaan pettymyksen  sitä pimentämättä, aivan pilvettömänä. Kuinka heidän sittemmin  kävisikin, niin voisivat he kuitenkin muistissa iloita siitä, että he  ainakin kerran ovat tunteneet puhdasta ja epäitsekästä hellyyttä, joka,  nuorena, tahrattomana ja melkeinpä sukupuoliaatosta vailla, oli tullut  ja käynyt heidän, täysikasvuisten, elämän kynnykselle. Tämä oli päätös,  sen he molemmat käsittivät. Ja he iloitsivat siitä, että niin piti  olla. He eivät puhuneet enää toisilleen kirjoittamisestakaan. Vielä kerran tulivat he tuohon mustikanvarsia ja sänkeä kasvavaan  pieneen puoliympyrään, joka sijaitsi rannan ja ylimmän törmän  keskivaiheella, ja istuivat siellä kauan aikaa ja katsoivat alas yli  pitkähköjen, viheriäisten aallokkojen, jotka lakkaamatta tulivat  vierien kohti rantaa ja siellä raskaan, viheriän veden ja soluvan  vaahdon räjähdyksestä taittuivat. Ja katse seurasi niiden leveitä  kolonneja yhä kauemmaksi ja kauemmaksi merelle, kunnes yksityiset  viivat sulautuivat yhteen valtavaksi, viheriäksi, alati vaihettelevaksi  massaksi, joka houkutteli silmää yhä edemmäksi, aina taivaanrannan  terävään, hienosti kaareutuvaan ääriviivaan. Se ei ollut yksityiskohtien maalausta. Siinä oli vain laaja merenpinta,  sinisen taivaan suunnaton syvyys ja maan alastomat, viheliäiset  rinteet — olemassa-olomuodot kolmessa mahdottoman suuressa koossa,  muuttumattomina ikuisista ajoista asti. Tämä ei ollut typerien  tuumattujen eikä pikkumaisen harkinnan paikka. Tietämättään kuulosteli  mieli taaempaa noita leveitä ja yksinkertaisia perustunteita, rodun  perusvaistoja. Maan ja ilman ja veden valtava paikallisuus toi mukanaan  ystävällisen, mutta tavattoman voimantunteen — voiman, samanlaisen kuin  elementtien oma, raikas, mestaroimaton, uusi ja nuori voima. Siinä oli  jotakin huumaavaa; aavistus jostakin hauskasta, jostakin virkistävästä,  joka salpasi henkeä; tunne jostakin suuresta, jostakin salaisesta,  niin, niinkuin olisi taas tuntenut ja nähnyt inhimillisen, luonnollisen  elämän ja sen alkuperäiset ehdot, nuo vastustamattomat, muuttumattomat  ja lannistumattomat; elämän, ikivanhan kuin meri, äärettömän kuin  mittaamaton maailman avaruus. Condy ja Blix istuivat hiljaa kuunnellen ja katsellen ja huomioita  tehden; he eivät ajatelleet, he tunsivat, niin että he hehkuivat  ja vapisivat siitä. Hämärästi huomasivat he hetken merkityksen.  Molempien sydänten koskemattoman hiljaisessa, syvässä syvyydessä oli  jotakin, joka nousi ja nousi lähemmä tietoisuutta ja päivän valoa.  Meiltä puuttuu sanoja niille asioille, meillä ei ole nimeä sille  mysteriolle, joka luo sillan miehen ja naisen välillä olevan kuilun yli  — sille mysteriolle, jolla ei ole mitään tekemistä heidän keskinäisen  rakkautensa kanssa, mutta joka on jotakin parempaa kuin rakkaus,  jotakin eriskummallista, joka aivan yksinkertaisesti tapahtuu. Päivä päättyi. Aurinko meni mailleen. Silloin nousi Blix. »Meidän olisi pitänyt mennä aikaa sitten», sanoi hän. He riensivät  kohti korkeuksia, ja Condy sanoi: »Minulla on mitä merkillisin tunne siitä, että minä jollakin tavalla  olen istunut ja nukkunut silmät auki. Kuinka se auringonlasku oli  komea! Minusta tuntuu, että joka minuutti on kuin kokonainen elämä.  Ooh, Blix, onko mitään maailmassa, jota voi verrata siihen, että  rakastaa toisiaan, niinkuin me kaksi?» He olivat nyt sivuuttaneet ensimmäisen töyryn ja menivät suoraan  yli ilmavan, avonaisen tasangon, jota siniset iriskukat ja villit  heliotroopit tähtipilvinä verhosivat. Blix veti Condyn käsivarren  vyötäykselleen ja pani poskensa hänen olalleen pienellä, lempeällä  liikkeellä. »Oi, niin, kuulehan», sanoi hän, »minä rakastan sinua, rakastan  sinua koko sydämestäni ja myös ainiaan, sen tiedän. Aina näihin  kolmeen, neljään viime päivään asti olen ollut lapsi — oikea lapsi,  oma ystäväni, en juuri mikään vakava lapsi, pelkään; minä ikäänkuin  en välittänyt muusta kuin siitä, mikä tapahtui aivan lähelläni —  ymmärrätkö mitä tarkoitan? Mutta senjälkeen kun huomasin kuinka paljon  sinua rakastin ja ymmärsin, että myöskin sinä rakastat minua — niin,  silloin oli kaikki muuttunut. Minä olen itse muuttunut. Minä iloitsen  nyt asioista, joista en ikinä ennen ole uneksinutkaan voivani iloita,  ja minä tunnen itseni ikäänkuin suuremmaksi , ymmärrätkö? — ja  voimakkaammaksi ja paljon vakavammaksi. Aivan äsken vielä olin vain  nuori tyttö, mutta nyt, kun rakastan sinua, Condy, luulen, että minä —  äkkiä ja itse sitä tietämättä — olen tullut naiseksi!» Vieno väristys puistatti häntä, kun hän tämän sanoi. Hän pysähtyi,  kietoi käsivarret hänen kaulaansa ja taivutti päänsä taapäin, puoleksi  suljetuin silmin, samalla kun hänen tuuhea tukkansa aaltoili yli  otsan. Koko hänen olentonsa huokui tuota suloista, raikasta tuoksua,  joka tuli hänen vaatteistaan, hänen kaulastaan, hänen käsivarsistaan,  hänen hiuksistaan, hänen suustaan — tuo eloisa, melkein taivaallinen  naisellinen tuoksu, joka oli osa häntä itseään. »Sinä rakastat minua, Condy, rakastathan? Niinkuin minäkin sinua  rakastan?» Kaikki sanat olivat niin surkean köyhiä. Condy saattoi vastaukseksi  vain painaltaa hänet lujemmin puoleensa. Blix ymmärsi hänet. Hän  sulki hitaasti silmänsä kokonaan ja lähensi kasvonsa häntä kohti. Hän  kuiskasi niin hiljaa — hiljaa: »Condy, minä rakastan sinua!» »Minä rakastan sinua, Blix.» Ja he suutelivat toisiaan, tällä kertaa suulle. Mutta aurinko oli mennyt mailleen. Mikä auringonlasku. Koko laaja  maailma maata ja taivasta ja merta oli sen elävän hehkun läpitunkema;  merenpinta lepäsi hehkuvan punaisena, vuoret olivat ametisteja, taivas  yhtenä ainoana suunnattoman suurena opaalina, ja täällä leijailivat he  yhdessä keskellä valoloistoa kuin maailman luomisessa. Oli todellakin  uudenvuoden päivä; maa oli uudestaan luotu ja vuosi oli uusi, ja  heidän rakkautensa uusi ja voimakas. Entisyyttä ja nykyisyyttä ei enää  ollut. Heidän uudessa maailmassaan ei ollut tilaa katumukselle eikä  muistoille. Siinä oli toivoa, toivoa, toivoa; se lauloi heille, kutsui  heitä ja sai uuden ja uljaan veren hehkumaan heidän suonissaan. Aivan yht'äkkiä oli ihme siinä niinkuin vasta syttynyt tähti, jonka  säteitä he eivät nähneet, vaan kuitenkin tajusivat, niinkuin valtava  sävelvuo, jonka sointuja he eivät kuulleet, vaan kuitenkin huomasivat.  Kun he siinä seisoivat koko tässä taivaan ja maan ja meren todellisessa  sädeloistossa, tiesivät he äkkiä, että he olivat toistensa omat ainaisesti, hyvinä ja pahoina päivinä, kunnes kuolema eroittaisi  heidät. Heidän seikkailuunsa, heidän iloonsa nykyisyydestä, heidän  onneensa siitä, mikä oli, tuli äkkiä suuri ja pysyväinen ilo, onni  elämän vakavan pohjavirran tähden — onni niin syvä, niin harras, että  se värisytti heitä juhlan ja ihmeen tunteella. Tämä uudenvuoden päivä  ei olisi päätös, vaan se olisi heidän todellisen elämäntarinansa alku.  Koko Condyn kaunis, miehekäs ja miehuullinen tarmo oli aivan valveilla  ja valmiina. Koko Blixin suloinen ja voimakas naisellisuus oli äkkiä  syventynyt ja avartunut. Lyhyesti sanottuna: Condystä oli tullut mies  ja Blixistä nainen. Nuoruutta, elämää ja miehen ja naisen rakkautta,  kukkuloiden voimaa ja meren syvyyttä ja läntisen taivaan ihanuutta,  sitä oli uusi vuosi antanut heille. *       *       *       *       * »Nyt on meidän sitten hyvästeltävä?» sanoi Blix. »Ei», sanoi Condy. »Ei, Blix. Kuinka usein tämän ihmeellisen  uudenvuodenpäivän jälkeen eroammekin, kuinka kaukana toisistamme  olemmekin, me kaksi emme koskaan, emme koskaan hyvästele toisiamme.» »Ei, olet oikeassa!» sanoi Blix kyynelten loistaessa hänen tumman  ruskeissa silmissään. »Ei, niin kauan, kun me rakastamme toisiamme,  ei mikään voi meitä eroittaa, ei etäisyyskään. Sinä voit olla täällä  Tyynen meren rannalla ja minä tuolla Atlannin meren rannikolla, mutta  suoraan yli koko mannermaan olemme kuitenkin me kaksi .» »Ja me tapaamme taas, Blix», sanoi Condy, »siihen ei nyt tule olemaan  pitkälti. Suo minulle vain aikaa pari vuotta.» »Niin kauan kun me rakastamme toisiamme, ei aikakaan voi meitä  eroittaa.» »Mitä sinä itket, pikku Blixie?» kysyi Condy pyyhkien hänen poskiaan. »Sentähden, että tämä on surullisin ja iloisin päivä minun elämässäni»,  vastasi hän. Sitten vetäytyi hän hänestä hiukan hymyillen loitommaksi  ja sanoi: »Katso, Condy, sinä pudotit kirjeen. Sinä vedit sen  taskustasi nenäliinan mukana.» Kun Condy otti kirjeen ylös, näki hän Riemukustannusliikkeen leiman  kirjeenkuorella. »Se on se, jonka sain käsikirjoituksen mukana, jonka he lähettivät  takaisin», selitti hän. »Mitä he sitten kirjoittavat?» »Ooh, kaiketikin tuota tavallista. Minä en ole sitä lukenut. Katsonpa  nyt.» Hän aukaisi kirjeen ja luki: »Rohkenemme täten kunnioittaen palauttaa käsikirjoituksen Teidän   romaaniinne ’Viranomaisista huolimatta’, valittaen sitä, ettei meidän   konsulenttimme uskalla suosittaa sitä julkaistavaksi tällä hetkellä.   Olemme kuitenkin mielenkiinnolla seuranneet Teidän toimintaanne,   ja me olemme m.m. eräässä vaihtolehdessämme nähneet erään Teidän   kertomuksenne, nimeltä ’Kuoleman voitto’, jonka olisimme halusta   julkaisseet, jos Te olisitte suonut meille tilaisuuden siihen. Mitä Te arvelette aputoimittajan paikasta meidän kirjallisessa ja   arvostelevassa aikakauskirjassamme Neljännes, jota me julkaisemme   täällä New-Yorkissa ja jonka otaksumme Teidän tuntevan? Emme luule,   että asian taloudellisen puolen järjestäminen tuottaa mitään   vaikeuksia. Siltä varalta, että Te päättäisitte matkustaa tänne,   oheenliitämme piletin rautatielle San Francisco—New-Yorkin keskus. Kunnioittavimmin Riemukustannusliike, New-York.» He katsoivat toisiaan. Blix oli liian liikutettu voidakseen puhua;  hänen huuliltaan tuli vain puoleksi tukahdutettu, värisevä huokaus.  Tämä kirje oli todellakin Deus ex machina, ainoa, mikä puuttui  tehdäkseen heidän onnensa täydelliseksi. »Minä en tiedä mitä sinä siitä pidät», alkoi Condy koettaen olla  levollinen, »mutta minusta näyttää niinkuin — niinkuin — se — —» He eivät sittemmin koskaan voineet muistaa mitä he sillä kertaa  sanoivat. Auringonlaskun kultainen usva verhosi salaperäisellä tavalla  tämän tuokion muistoa, ja he saattoivat vain muistaa, että he olivat  olleet iloisemmat kuin koskaan ennen. Ehkä niin iloiset, etteivät he koskaan enää niin iloisiksi tulisi.  He alkoivat tuntea eron ilon ja onnen välillä. Tämä uudenvuodenpäivä  merkitsi heille lopettamista ja johdantoa. Se oli kolme kuukautta kestäneen iloisen vastuuttoman  silmänräpäyselämän loppu, ja se oli johdanto uuteen elämään, jonka  mahdollisuudet suruun ja huoleen, nautintoon ja onneen ylittivät kaiken  mitä he tähän asti olivat tunteneet. He tiesivät sen — he tunsivat sen  vaistomaisesti, kun he kumpikin yht'äkkiä kääntyivät ympäri katsomaan  hehkuvaa maata ja taivasta ja merta, esiinvierivää aallokkoa, rannikkoa  ja ahavoitunutta vanhaa linnoitusta loitompana — koko tätä seutua, joka  avautui siinä heidän eteensä kuvastaen heidän kallista, vapaata ja  huoletonta toveruuttaan näiden kuukausien kuluessa. Heidän uusi onnensa  ei enää ollut aivan vailla surumielisyyttä. Kaikki tuo oli nyt ohi;  heidän yksinäiset vaelluksensa, pitkät, rauhalliset illat ruokasalissa,  josta näki yli nukkuvan kaupungin, heidän ateriansa Lunalla, heidän  iltapäivänsä kultaisessa seinäsolassa kiinalaiskaupungissa, heidän  rauhalliset aamunsa järvellä tyynellä ja lämpöisellä säällä. Sille  elämälle olivat he nyt sanoneet ikuiset jäähyväiset. Auringonlasku  alkoi menettää loistoaan. Vielä viimeinen pitkä silmäys — sitten kääntyivät he reippaasti ja  suuntasivat katseensa eteenpäin, kohti uutta elämää, kohti itää, jossa  kansa oli. Kaukana Sierran purppuranvärisen vallituksen takana oli  ankaran maailman meluisa koneisto käynnissä, — tuon maailman, jota  heidän nyt piti oppia tuntemaan, tuon maailman, joka kutsui heitä,  herätti heidät ja kiihoitti heitä taisteluun. Heidän hilpeytensä pieni  olotila oli ohi; pienten asioiden aika oli eletty. Nyt oli kysymyksessä  tulevaisuus. Oli kosketettu syvempää säveltä — nyt oli tehtävä työtä;  myöskin tämän oli uusi vuosi tuonut heille — työtä heille molemmille,  työtä ja kasvaneen maailman. Tuokion verran oli niinkuin he olisivat tahtoneet perääntyä, niinkuin  he eivät olisi mielellään tahtoneet astua ensimmäistä askelta sen  puutarhan rajojen yli, jossa he olivat eläneet niin juhlien ja oppineet  rakastamaan toisiaan. Ja kun he seisoivat siellä, katse käännettynä  kohti tummaa, harmaantuvaa itätaivasta ja auringonlaskua heidän  takanaan, painautui Blix lujemmin häneen, pisti kätensä hänen käteensä  ja katsoi hiukan hätääntyneenä hänen silmiinsä. Mutta Condyn käsivarsi  tuki häntä, ja voimakas, nuori tahto, joka hänen katseessaan kohtasi  häntä, valoi häneen rohkeutta. »Hyvää uutta vuotta, Condy», sanoi hän. »Niin», vastasi hän, »oikein onnellista uutta vuotta, Blix!» *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NUORUUDEN RAKKAUTTA *** Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will  be renamed.

If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the  United States and you are located in the United States, we do not  claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,  displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as  all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope  that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting  free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™  works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the  Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily  comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the  same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when  you share it without charge with others. 1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern  what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are  in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,  check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this  agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,  distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any  other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no  representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any  country other than the United States. 1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg: 1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other  immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear  prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work  on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the  phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,  performed, viewed, copied or distributed: This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most      other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions      whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms      of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online      at www.gutenberg.org . If you      are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws      of the country where you are located before using this eBook. 1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is  derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not  contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the  copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in  the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are  redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project  Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply  either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or  obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™  trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9. 1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted  with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution  must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any  additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms  will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works  posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the  beginning of this work. 1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™  License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this  work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™. 1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this  electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without  prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with  active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project  Gutenberg™ License. 1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,  compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including  any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access  to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format  other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official  version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website  (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense  to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means  of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain  Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the  full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1. 1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,  performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works  unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9. 1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing  access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works  provided that: • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from          the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method          you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed          to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has          agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project          Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid          within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are          legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty          payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project          Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in          Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg          Literary Archive Foundation.” • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies          you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he          does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™          License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all          copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue          all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™          works. • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of          any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the          electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of          receipt of the work. • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free          distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works. 1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project  Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than  are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing  from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of  the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set  forth in Section 3 below. 1.F. 1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable  effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread  works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project  Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™  electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may  contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate  or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other  intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or  other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or  cannot be read by your equipment. 1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right  of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project  Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project  Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all  liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal  fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT  LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE  PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE  TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE  LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR  INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH  DAMAGE. 1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a  defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can  receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a  written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you  received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium  with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you  with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in  lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person  or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second  opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If  the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing  without further opportunities to fix the problem. 1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth  in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO  OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT  LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. 1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied  warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of  damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement  violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the  agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or  limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or  unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the  remaining provisions. 1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the  trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone  providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in  accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the  production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™  electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,  including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of  the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this  or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or  additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any  Defect you cause. Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™ Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of  computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It  exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations  from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the  assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will  remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future  generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see  Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org. Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit  501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the  state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal  Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification  number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by  U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws. The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,  Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up  to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website  and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg  Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread  public support and donations to carry out its mission of  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be  freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest  array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt  status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United  States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up  with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND  DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state  visit www.gutenberg.org/donate . While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who  approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from  outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation  methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To  donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate. Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project  Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be  freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and  distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of  volunteer support. Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed  editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in  the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not  necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper  edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search  facility: www.gutenberg.org . This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\""
